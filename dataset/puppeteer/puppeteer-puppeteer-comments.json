Also, I tried to set the waitforselector  timeout to \"0\" but this resulted in my job timing out after 10 minutes due to my configuration.

        "Comment Body": "A bit more troubleshooting since my initial post, this page is pulling data from a database and Puppeteer is losing focus on the field that doesn't get completed (if I add a chai expect in after each page.type, when it fails to fill out a field completely the screenshot it takes does not have focus on the input field).\r\n\r\nI think what may be happening is puppeteer is just running too quickly and it begins filling in the fields, at some point during this the page finishes getting data from the server and refreshes the page (not a browser refresh.....I'm using React & Redux, so the state updates with the fetched data and refreshes the display).\r\n\r\nThis loss of focus is not ever seen by a user (because they won't select an input as quickly as puppeteer will) so it's only an issue with puppeteer itself, I can force it to work fine if I make puppeteer wait 500ms after landing on the page (which is enough time for DB calls to resolve locally but may not work in my remote environment).\r\n\r\nI've also tried waiting for networkidle and what not, but I'm getting to this page with a click action not a network call so I don't think I can easily wait for networkidle.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how best to work around this issue? I don't like waiting for a static time because it will just introduce test flakiness in different environments."

I don't like waiting for a static time because it will just introduce test flakiness in different environments.\r\n\r\n@Nagisan I'd try a few options here:\r\n- if the page fetches something over network and you know the url it loads, you can subscribe to the [`requestfinished`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#event-requestfinished) event and wait for the request to finish\r\n- if you have access to the website codebase, you might issue a call to `console.timeStamp` with some label, e.g. `console.timeStamp('mynicelabel')`. In puppeteer, you'll get a related [`metrics`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer/blob/master/docs/api.md#event-metrics) event with a `'mynicelabel'` title \r\n\r\n"

I often alter my css and draw borders around the objects (`style=\"border: 1px solid red;\"`) so you can see where the objects ends and what is spilling over.\r\n\r\nMost often your local browser (Chrome is of course best to use) agrees with Puppeteer so load your HTML in the browser an select to \"Print...\" (set printer to \"Save as PDF\" or similar) and you'll see in the preview how many pages it's going to print. \r\nThe alter your css to lessen the height/width of your objects to make sure only one page is printed.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a header/footer in Puppeteer then you need to make room for those as well so you'd have to lessen your height of the \"page\". There also it helps to add a border around the header and footer to make it visible. **NB!** somethins the footer is added as a tiny small box so make sure you add some \"font-size\" to the header/footer objects.\r\n\r\nSometimes it helps adding this if no obvious object is spilling over:\r\n```\r\n        @media print {\r\n            /* prevent blank page at end */\r\n            table:last-of-type { page-break-after: auto; }\r\n            html, body {\r\n                height: 100%;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```"

In the second command, you should see the output like `Opening in existing browser session.` indicating that it detected the previously launched process and handled the command there closing the second process. Puppeteer on the hand always launches a new process and the browser instance as alive as long as the process is alive and does not support switching between profiles. Each Chrome browser process wants a singleton lock of the user-data dir, that's why you see a failure. You can start the two profiles via the commands and connect the browser instance using https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.puppeteer.connect/  or you can create temporary profiles using https://pptr.dev/api/puppeteer.browser.createbrowsercontext/. For now, we do not have plans on changing this behavior. "

The safest way is to copy a profile ahead of time. Btw, also forgot to mention that `headless: 'shell'` does not have this restriction but it is technically a different browser implementation from Chrome (see https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromium/headless for details).

It is possible that electron cleans the userDataDir. Puppeteer should only delete the user data dir if a custom userDataDir was not provided and Puppeteer generated its own user data dir folder. Duplicating the user-data-dir in the args should not matter because what `userDataDir` does is adding adding that argument."

I wouldn't do `await = foo.click({ clickCount: 3 });` because relies on the OS to have this enabled and work everywhere, you don't want to worry about this breaking.\r\n\r\nI'm actually doing your second solution right now, but I like your first solution more. I don't feel very comfortable with that because if some script on the page changes your focus between the select and type, it will break. The most robust I still think is the 2nd solution."

The main problem of this solution is that you are actually injecting a JavaScript code in the website. That means it will not work for TypeScript, async/await, external variables. For example\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  const myVar = 'hello'\r\n  await page.evaluate(() => {\r\n    const a: string = 'hello' -> Syntax Error, not work for TypeScript.\r\n    \r\n    console.log(myVar) -> Variable myVar is not defined\r\n\r\n    async a() {} -> Some browser hasn't support await/async syntax yet\r\n  })\r\n```"

When this function returns, every variable declared within the function remains in memory. The callback function that was passed to `page.evaluate()` is also stored in memory, in the form of a string! It makes no difference if I call `page.close()` and `browser.close()` after every single `page.evaluate()`... the variables still continue to accumulate in memory until the program runs out of memory and crashes. I've even tried manually running the garbage collector after every `page.evaluate()`, but it doesn't get rid of the variables.\r\n\r\n**This is a big problem for those of us who are using puppeteer for web scraping!!**"

        "Comment Body": "> I've determined that the memory leak is happening in `page.evaluate()`\r\n\r\n@jpgklassen TL;DR: I didn't find a leak here.\r\n\r\nI ran DevTools allocation profiler against a simple script:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst puppeteer = require('puppeteer');\r\n\r\n(async () => {\r\n    const browser = await puppeteer.launch();\r\n    const page = await browser.newPage();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i < 10000; ++i) {\r\n      await page.evaluate(i => console.log(i), i);\r\n    }\r\n})();\r\n```\r\nThe result **does look** like there's a leak:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/53665740-22fb6980-3c21-11e9-96eb-332ba4425855.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, if you run this with a new-enough node (I ran node 11), you'll notice that the retainer is a DevTools debugger.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/53665830-65bd4180-3c21-11e9-8523-438b0a4bdcca.png)\r\n\r\nThis is actually a DevTools bug: `page.evaluate` creates a function object to validate input, and DevTools debugger retains the script source to provide debugging capabilities.We should either disable a debugger or filter out devtools-specific GC roots.\r\n\r\nRunning the script with a quick fix yields the following trace:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/746130/53666193-4ffc4c00-3c22-11e9-979a-375a8e870b22.png)\r\n\r\nThere are some weird memory allocations here and there, but they have nothing to do with Puppeteer's evaluate.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo sum up:\r\n- there's no leak in `page.evaluate()`\r\n- there *is* a bug in DevTools allocation profiler. We'll get it fixed soon (cc @a1ph), thanks for bringing this up!\r\n- you're running out of memory for some other reason; it could be your page re-use policy. It is very important to close the page and create a new one every once in a while; otherwise, Chromium will slowly grow render area for the page's renderer over time.\r\n- can you please check if you have the same behavior on older Puppeteer versions?"

Can you have a chart with a breakdown of memory allocations between processes? Since there are many parties involved, I wonder who's fault is this: node's, chrome's, or mongo's. "

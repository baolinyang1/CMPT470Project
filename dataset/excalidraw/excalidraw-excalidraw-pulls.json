See npm's documentation about <a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/\">semver</a> for more information.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Restrict access to esbuild's development server (<a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99\">GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99</a>)</p>\n<p>This change addresses esbuild's first security vulnerability report. Previously esbuild set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to <code>*</code> to allow esbuild's development server to be flexible in how it's used for development. However, this allows the websites you visit to make HTTP requests to esbuild's local development server, which gives read-only access to your source code if the website were to fetch your source code's specific URL. You can read more information in <a href=\"https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99\">the report</a>.</p>\n<p>Starting with this release, <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS\">CORS</a> will now be disabled, and requests will now be denied if the host does not match the one provided to <code>--serve=</code>. The default host is <code>0.0.0.0</code>, which refers to all of the IP addresses that represent the local machine (e.g. both <code>127.0.0.1</code> and <code>192.168.0.1</code>). If you want to customize anything about esbuild's development server, you can <a href=\"https://esbuild.github.io/api/#serve-proxy\">put a proxy in front of esbuild</a> and modify the incoming and/or outgoing requests.</p>\n<p>In addition, the <code>serve()</code> API call has been changed to return an array of <code>hosts</code> instead of a single <code>host</code> string. This makes it possible to determine all of the hosts that esbuild's development server will accept.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/sapphi-red\"><code>@\u200bsapphi-red</code></a> for reporting this issue.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Delete output files when a build fails in watch mode (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3643\">#3643</a>)</p>\n<p>It has been requested for esbuild to delete files when a build fails in watch mode. Previously esbuild left the old files in place, which could cause people to not immediately realize that the most recent build failed. With this release, esbuild will now delete all output files if a rebuild fails. Fixing the build error and triggering another rebuild will restore all output files again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fix correctness issues with the CSS nesting transform (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3620\">#3620</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3877\">#3877</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3933\">#3933</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3997\">#3997</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4005\">#4005</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4037\">#4037</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4038\">#4038</a>)</p>\n<p>This release fixes the following problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Naive expansion of CSS nesting can result in an exponential blow-up of generated CSS if each nesting level has multiple selectors. Previously esbuild sometimes collapsed individual nesting levels using <code>:is()</code> to limit expansion. However, this collapsing wasn't correct in some cases, so it has been removed to fix correctness issues.</p>\n<pre lang=\"css\"><code>/* Original code */\n.parent {\n  &gt; .a,\n  &gt; .b1 &gt; .b2 {\n    color: red;\n  }\n}\n<p>/* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */<br />\n.parent &gt; :is(.a, .b1 &gt; .b2) {<br />\ncolor: red;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>/* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */<br />\n.parent &gt; .a,<br />\n.parent &gt; .b1 &gt; .b2 {<br />\ncolor: red;<br />\n}<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/tim-we\"><code>@\u200btim-we</code></a> for working on a fix.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The <code>&amp;</code> CSS nesting selector can be repeated multiple times to increase CSS specificity. Previously esbuild ignored this possibility and incorrectly considered <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to have the same specificity as <code>&amp;</code>. With this release, this should now work correctly:</p>\n<pre lang=\"css\"><code>/* Original code (color should be red) */\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case <em>and</em> there are <code>#private</code> instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to <code>super()</code> (since <code>super()</code> is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:</p>\n<pre lang=\"ts\"><code>// Original code\nclass Foo extends Bar {\n  #private = 1;\n  public: any;\n  constructor() {\n    super();\n  }\n}\n<p>// Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)<br />\nclass Foo extends Bar {<br />\nconstructor() {<br />\nsuper();<br />\nthis.#private = 1;<br />\n}<br />\n#private;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>// Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)<br />\nclass Foo extends Bar {<br />\nconstructor() {<br />\nthis.#private = 1;<br />\nsuper();<br />\n}<br />\n#private;<br />\n}</p>\n<p>// New output<br />\nclass Foo extends Bar {<br />\n#private = 1;<br />\nconstructor() {<br />\nsuper();<br />\n}<br />\n}<br />\n</code></pre></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Minifier: allow reording a primitive past a side-effect (<a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3568\">#3568</a>)</p>\n<p>The minifier previously allowed reordering a side-effect past a primitive, but didn't handle the case of reordering a primitive past a side-effect.

The problem occurs because the data is not being properly saved when a collaborator leaves the room. so i fixed it by modifying the stopCollaboration method in Collab.tsx to ensure data is properly saved before a user leaves.\r\n\r\nI've made the following changes to fix the issue:\r\n1. Made the stopCollaboration method asynchronous by adding the async keyword to properly handle promises.\r\n2. Added await to saveCollabRoomToFirebase call to ensure it completes before proceeding.\r\n3.Added a call to queueSaveToFirebase.flush() with await before destroying the socket client to ensure any pending changes are saved\r\n\r\nI've made the following additional changes:\r\n1.In ShareDialog.tsx, updated the stopCollaboration call to use .then() to handle the async operation properly.\r\n2.In App.tsx, added await to both stopCollaboration calls and made the containing function async where needed.\r\n\r\nThese changes ensure that:\r\n1.When a user leaves the room, their changes are properly saved to Firebase before the connection is closed\r\n2.Any pending changes in the queue are flushed and saved before destroying the socket client\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ensures proper saving of collaboration data when users leave the room.\r\nFixes #9104",

        "This pull request introduces automated accessibility testing to the Excalidraw project, leveraging Axe-core and Playwright.\r\n\r\n**Importance of Accessibility Monitoring:**\r\n\r\nIn today's digital landscape, ensuring accessibility is not merely a technical consideration but a fundamental principle of inclusivity. Accessibility testing plays a crucial role in identifying and rectifying barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully engaging with and benefiting from digital content. By proactively monitoring accessibility, we create a more equitable and user-friendly environment for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.\r\n\r\n**Benefits of Automated Accessibility Testing:**\r\n\r\n- **Early Issue Detection:** Automated accessibility tests, integrated into the development workflow, enable early detection of accessibility issues, preventing them from propagating into production and becoming more costly to fix.\r\n- **Increased Efficiency:** Automated testing streamlines the accessibility evaluation process, saving valuable time and resources compared to manual assessments.\r\n- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Automated tools can systematically scan web pages and identify a wide range of potential accessibility violations, ensuring more thorough coverage than manual testing alone.\r\n- **Continuous Improvement:** By incorporating accessibility testing into the CI/CD pipeline, we foster a culture of continuous improvement, where accessibility is consistently evaluated and addressed throughout the development lifecycle.\r\n- **Enhanced User Experience:** Ultimately, automated accessibility testing leads to a better user experience for everyone, including individuals with disabilities, by ensuring that digital content is usable, navigable, and understandable.\r\n\r\n**Implementation Details:**\r\n\r\n- The tests are implemented using Axe-core and Playwright, two widely adopted and reliable tools for accessibility testing.\r\n- The tests are integrated into the GitHub Actions workflow, ensuring they are automatically executed on every pull request and push to the master branch.\r\n- The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/accessibility-check.yml`.\r\n- The accessibility test script is located at `scripts/accessibility-test.js`.\r\n- The generated accessibility report is uploaded as an artifact for review.\r\n\r\nI have diligently followed the contributing guidelines of the Excalidraw project.\r\n\r\nI kindly request your review and approval of this pull request.",

        "perf: Improved pointer events related performance when the sidebar is docked with a large library open",
        "When the sidebar is docked with a sufficiently large library open, there is some perceptible lag and choppiness during canvas interaction. This PR aims to improve performance and UX in this scenario.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse + our offline discussion led me to investigate any unnecessary re-renders. Something that both `LibraryMenu` and `LibraryMenuContent` are guilty of. By memoizing both components, I managed to mitigate this. With it, I also improved the `pending elements calculation`, as in the current version, rotation and resizing do not update the preview element correctly. These optimizations helped somewhat, but did not fully resolve the performance issue.\r\n\r\nMy next thought was that it might be the large number of (potentially) complex SVGs in the sidebar that may be the culprit. One approach I tried was lazy loading them with `IntersectionObserver`. The idea was to only insert the currently visible ones into the DOM. This showed some promise and definitely seemed to result in noticeably improved performance, but it still did not match the sidebar-less version.\r\n\r\nHowever, this detour helped me identify the real bottleneck. I noticed that although pointer events no longer triggered React re-renders, there was still some unusual behavior. After some more investigation, I found that the App component frequently changes the `--ui-pointerEvent` CSS variable to block other elements' interactivity, and applying these changes was the root cause of the lags.\r\n\r\nMy proposed solution is to remove these changes while maintaining the same UX (i.e., no interaction with outside elements during canvas interaction). During a canvas pointer up event, we capture the pointer events to the canvas itself. This ensures that all other outside elements will be non-interactive until a pointer up event. I tested this solution and it provides the same UX as before, though there could be some edge cases I'm not aware of. Unfortunately, I have noticed the tests are failing because `pepjs`, the library that polyfills pointer events to `jsdom` does not properly support the capturing phase for pointer events. Still, I think this idea is worth considering at least.\r\n\r\nHere is a short video comparing prod vs PR performance with the fix applied:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e01138a5-d182-4850-ae63-8d934dd32b0e",

It also cannot be just `undefined`, as then `document.fonts.load` won't load all necessary font faces (it could load just one irrelevant font-face containing latin chars, even though the text element contains CJK or extended latin character like `\u0161`).

        "![380760733-c5004ca1-e626-4967-a953-f85a0269f4bf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de2f2d2-b81e-4492-ac99-26ea480459b9)\r\n\r\n## What's in this PR?\r\n- Main goal was to allow manual positioning of elbow arrow segments on either horizontal or vertical direction (depending on its original heading)\r\n- The movement of segments happen via showing a control knob at every segment midpoint, reusing the idiom from editable linear elements\r\n- Secondary goal was to keep the modified segment unchanged, except the directional displacement (so the length of the moved segment is fixed)\r\n- The fixed segments can be \"released\" when double clicking on the hollow control know at the middle of the segment\r\n- Additionally this PR consolidates all elbow arrow modification into `mutateElement()` so the complexity is hidden for other developers.\r\n- This PR also bring a fix for \"misaligned\" but very close parallel segments, avoiding a visual glitch\r\n\r\n## Key implementation details\r\n- `packages/excalidraw/element/routing.ts` is renamed to `packages/excalidraw/element/elbowarrow.ts`\r\n- The `LinearElementEditor` class contains handlers for segment midpoint logic, but due to a likely state mismatch / race condition a completely new midpoint handling was implemented for elbow arrows.\r\n- Elbow arrow creation and updates needed different inputs, so the `LinearElementEditor::movePoints()` function was extensively updated to cover both elbow arrows and simple arrows.\r\n- Due to a UX requirement where an elbow arrow is bound on both ends and the second segment is fixed, then the start (or end) of the arrow is dragged to a perpendicular side of the bound element, there are two new properties on elbow arrow elements, `startIsSpecial` and `endIsSpecial` respectively.\r\n![a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0cfaae-17ed-4f9c-bd5e-51851993c61e)\r\n\r\n- To store the fixed segments data on the elbow arrow elements a new property is introduced, called `fixedSegments`. It is an array of objects, the objects contain \r\n\t- a segment index, which is the point index of the last point of a fixed segment in the `points` property (so it goes from 1 to length -1)\r\n\t- start, which is the element `LocalPoint` coordinate of the start of the fixed segment\r\n\t- end, which is the element `LocalPoint` coordinate of the end of the fixed segment\r\n- The elbow arrow generating algorithm on its own creates suboptimal arrow points with duplicates and hooks, which are simplified in a post processing step. This simplification results in loss of information for subsequent modification requests, so there are a lot of subtle heuristics to \"guess\" the lost information, which would be required to keep a stable visual experience.\r\n- The visual debugging is enhanced and refactored to make development easier (beyond elbow arrows)\r\n\r\n## Where to start a review\r\n### elbowarrow.ts\r\n- Start with reviewing the fist half of `packages/excalidraw/element/elbowarrow.ts`. The code in this file is organized around a single main entrypoint, `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)`. This is called from `mutateElement(...)` to calculate the changes needed, then returns the element updates required in the form of `ElementUpdate<ExcalidrawElbowArrowElement>`, which is then woven into the original logic of `mutateElement(...)`\r\n- The `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)` function is a dispatch function to handle 6 different use cases individually.\r\n- The original elbow arrow routing code is refactored into two separate functions, which are almost identical to the original code: `getElbowArrowData(...)` which just calculates the common parameters used by all the functions and `routeElbowArrow(...)` which contain the routing algorithm. The modifications in these compared to the original is minimal, only affecting spacing around bound elements.\r\n\r\n### mutateElement.ts\r\n- This contains the call to `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)` in `elbowarrow.ts` as a separate branch before the original code. This branch prepares the function arguments required for the elbow arrow code, then applies the resolved changes before handing over the control flow to the old code.\r\n- Due to the fact that elbow arrows need additional information in some use cases, a new optional `options` argument is added to the interface of `mutateElement(...)` which affects the public API.\r\n\r\n### LinearElementEditor.ts\r\n- Beyond the changes to `movePoints(...)` there are small modifications to the original code to handle elbow arrows\r\n- Additional functions introduced to cover the new use cases, `moveFixedSegment(...)` and `deleteFixedSegment(...)`\r\n- There are helper functions added to support these two main use case covering functions, which are also called from `components/App.tsx` handlers.\r\n\r\n### packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx\r\n- A new segment midpoint handler code is introduced due to the previously mentioned state handling bug\r\n- These modifications also hook into the segment movement and delete functions in `LinearElementEditor`.\r\n- Due to the special needs of elbow arrows, there are modifications to resize, flip, drag and restore functionalities for the elements (`dragElement.ts`, `resizeElement.ts`and `restore.ts`\r\n\r\n### fractionalIndex.ts\r\n- Due to the change in calling signature of `mutateElement(...)` changes were needed in `syncInvalidIndices(...)` and `syncMovedIndices(...)`",

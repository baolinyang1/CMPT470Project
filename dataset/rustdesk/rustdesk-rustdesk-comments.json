It's a bit of a mess of nested if statements so feel free to refactor that if you have a neater way of doing things. I believe this fixes the issue, let me know if changes to those are functions are necessary though. I haven't gotten to testing it in the main application, but I've tested it on its own and it correctly identifies the display server now on my setup which is Arch and startx (x11), stock Manjaro KDE (x11), and stock Fedora 34 (wayland).\r\n\r\nLmk if that looks ok and if you'd like me to open a PR or if you have something else in mind. Also, random fun fact, it looks like Teamviewer has this same issue according to this comment: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/teamviewer/?O=40&PP=10#comment-763211."

One other thing I was wondering is whether you'd be interested in including a Dockerfile for building the application, in case people want to use that method. I put a rough one together based on the build scripts in the README to test these changes and I figure it might be easier than trying to follow the scripts manually for a lot of people, it might also cut down on the number of build-related issues. Lmk if you're interested, if so I can clean it up and add documentation."

However, I could be wrong, but I don't think from looking at it that `get_display_server_of_session` is limited operating on any specific tty, I'm pretty sure it will operate on the session its called with, regardless of what tty it corresponds to. The function that calls it (`get_display_server`) will always call it with the session of seat0 though, so maybe that's related?\n\nLooking back on the code for `get_display_server_of_session` this many months later it could definitely use a rewrite; there's got to be a way to accomplish this without running so many shell commands. But again, I don't have the setup to test it..."

Today, I saw the 1.3.7 version update and updated it, and then the issue mentioned above occurred. I reverted to the 1.3.6 version, and everything works fine.\n\n\nAfter further testing, the 1.3.7 version only conflicts with the proxy software's TUN mode. After disabling the TUN mode, the 1.3.7 version works fine. The 1.3.6 version works normally with the proxy software's TUN mode enabled.\n\n\nI hope the engineers can fix this bug as soon as possible and add a feature to disable the detection of port 21114. For users who do not use the web client, the system keeps sending requests to check port 21114."

I understand that a lot of these companies moved in this direction because well they are companies and they need to make money However most of them are just plain greedy with their charge per user per PC mentality...\r\n\r\nthink about it .... there are billions of active PC users that require remote login capabilities especially now but times are changing with the workforce ... if you're charging an average of$1.00 a month with no other restrictions you're making a billion dollars a month just in subscription fees....... Why get greedy ??.. I mean it really makes no sense to me to be honest. "

I see it as a very good balance between needed features and effectivenes.\r\nIf it is possible to run multiple instances of Rustdesk on the local machine (I know you can do it now)  and the remote side has two monitors and you are also able to choose different monitors for the different instances, that would be great. The use case I can see here is 1. When the local side also has two monitors, you can run once instance on every monitor and the experience will be the same as if you are working on the remote side (when you are in full screen). 2. When you have one monitor on the local side (like a laptop), you can use Virtual desktop (Win10/11, Linux has it integrated) and you can have an instance for every virtual desktop and switch faster between the two monitors on the remote.\r\nAs for the suggested payment part. I personally support very much the model to have a completely free (community) edition that can be used by everyone and a paid one (enterprise) solution that can be either customized and/or different level of support. And the donation (crypto, buy me a coffee) should always be on the table as an option."

No need to update it.  \r\nIt is not the default feature.  \r\nAnd linux headless is a new experimental feature. There're still some TODOs here.\r\n\r\n> Do you think the same could be done with other very large and cluttered widgets? And also with huge files?\r\n\r\nYes. I think it is better. But I did not intentionally split the code. It was mainly due to seeing some duplicate code.\r\n"

Either on public rustdesk servers or self-hosted.\r\n\r\nSo being on `gnome` and/or Ubuntu is absolutely unneeded. Basically any Linux system on X11 with the mentioned driver will work, provided nothings goes in the way. That should make every Linux user happy \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\ude80 ! \r\n\r\nPS: While teamviewer doesn't even work on this setup, it doesn't detect any display as soon as I unlock the session on the LightDM screen. This really feels great ! Thanks @rustdesk !\r\n-->"

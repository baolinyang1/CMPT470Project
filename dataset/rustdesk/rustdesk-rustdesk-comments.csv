                    display_server
                }
            } else {
                display_server
            }
        } else {
            // If the session is not a tty, then just return the type as usual

```

Basically it just adds a check for whether the session type is tty, and if it is, it checks if Xorg is running on that tty. It's a bit of a mess of nested if statements so feel free to refactor that if you have a neater way of doing things. I believe this fixes the issue, let me know if changes to those are functions are necessary though. I haven't gotten to testing it in the main application, but I've tested it on its own and it correctly identifies the display server now on my setup which is Arch and startx (x11), stock Manjaro KDE (x11), and stock Fedora 34 (wayland).

Lmk if that looks ok and if you'd like me to open a PR or if you have something else in mind. Also, random fun fact, it looks like Teamviewer has this same issue according to this comment: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/teamviewer/?O=40&PP=10#comment-763211."

Good job, but you also need to modify `get_active_userid`, and `get_env`, RustDesk uses `get_env` to get `$DISPLAY` and `$XAUTHORITY` to make xdo and screen capture work. `get_active_userid` get the user id of the active X session."
87,closed,Unsupported display server type tty when running without display manager,864441859,rustdesk,2021-06-19T17:47:14Z,Have you test if you can get correct `$DISPLAY` and `$XAUTHORITY` with old get_env and your new `get_display_server_of_session`?

I don't think the bug was anything in the actual functionality, it was just these checks here that were preventing the program from trying to connect, because `get_display_server` was returning `tty` instead of `x11`, which is now fixed:

```
src/ui.rs
450:            if dtype != ""x11"" {
451:                return format!(""Unsupported display server type {}, x11 expected!"", dtype);

One other thing I was wondering is whether you'd be interested in including a Dockerfile for building the application, in case people want to use that method. I put a rough one together based on the build scripts in the README to test these changes and I figure it might be easier than trying to follow the scripts manually for a lot of people, it might also cut down on the number of build-related issues.

I just downloaded version 1.1.9 (latest, as of today), on an Ubuntu Linux, starting from tty with `startx`, I thought the bug would be corrected on version 1.1.9, but I still get the error message `Unsupported display server tty, x11 expected` :-(. 
```
$ ps -e |grep tty

   4089 tty1     00:00:00 bash
   4683 tty2     07:33:45 Xorg

I guess that's because I switched to `tty2` before running `startx`, and your code only checks the tty that has the login process (as I see from the patch).

However, I could be wrong, but I don't think from looking at it that `get_display_server_of_session` is limited operating on any specific tty, I'm pretty sure it will operate on the session its called with, regardless of what tty it corresponds to. The function that calls it (`get_display_server`) will always call it with the session of seat0 though, so maybe that's related?

Looking back on the code for `get_display_server_of_session` this many months later it could definitely use a rewrite; there's got to be a way to accomplish this without running so many shell commands. But again, I don't have the setup to test it..."

If it is possible to run multiple instances of Rustdesk on the local machine (I know you can do it now)  and the remote side has two monitors and you are also able to choose different monitors for the different instances, that would be great. The use case I can see here is 1. When the local side also has two monitors, you can run once instance on every monitor and the experience will be the same as if you are working on the remote side (when you are in full screen). 2. When you have one monitor on the local side (like a laptop), you can use Virtual desktop (Win10/11, Linux has it integrated) and you can have an instance for every virtual desktop and switch faster between the two monitors on the remote.
As for the suggested payment part. I personally support very much the model to have a completely free (community) edition that can be used by everyone and a paid one (enterprise) solution that can be either customized and/or different level of support.

Thanks mate, this worked for my with xserver-xorg-video-dummy installed, headless mode enables and the xorg config.
Restared lightdm and could connect.  Before that I used to get ""no diplay"" error (I dont have any monitor connected)

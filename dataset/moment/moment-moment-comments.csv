In general, you either need to be using `moment-with-locales.js`, or have loaded the locale data separately.  Most loaders will not automatically pick up the language file, so you may need to import them separately.

Basically, if you try to switch to a locale that's not loaded, moment will revert to the `en` locale.

You can't use 'import' in node.js yet. I haven't tried it myself, but I reckon that this would work:

require('moment/locale/fr')
moment.locale('fr');

Now the other thing is that when you clone a `moment` object by `moment(m)`, you preserve the locale of `m`, so even though the locale for new moments is `en` you keep the `de` locale that `m` has (`this.start` and `this.end` in your example).

2730,closed,moment cannot always parse moment default formatted negative years,163525715,ichernev,2015-12-10T07:45:01Z,"That is a weird one. If you use `toISOString()`, then it correctly outputs `-000001`, which can then be correctly parsed.

`format()` uses a default format with `YYYY`, that would then output `-0001`, which can then not be strictly parsed into ISO, because ISO forbids 4 digits with a sign, and states you should use more (and in moment we stick with 6 digits in this case).

On the other hand there is the problem that `YYYY` does not parse any leading signs, so if you have year : `y < 0 || y > 9999` it won't be parsed correctly with `YYYY`, even though it was formatted with `YYYY`.

If we change the way `YYYY` parsing works, it will break for cases like `'20151209', 'YYYYMMDD'`, because `YYYY` can in theory consume more than 4 digits (if the input was bigger), and this case is far more likely than the case with an year bigger than `9999` or negative. Only supporting negative is going to fix the issue presented here, but won't fix years above `9999`, or below `-9999`.
- So if the concern is `format() produces something unparsable` we can fix format to use `YYYYYY` instead for weird years.
- If the issue is that format('YYYY') can not be parsed with 'YYYY', then we can only (maybe) fix that for `y in (-9999, -1)`, because the other option is impossible.
- If the issue is that `-0001-...` is not valid ISO ... not sure what to do here, as the docs don't really specify anything about years below 1583, except ""the parties should reach an agreement"". So if the agreement was to use ISO string (`toISOString` not `format`), this is a non-issue.

3) Optionally require the locale to see that it IS printed

``` bash

Static code analysers can only make inferences based on patterns, but won't always know the full context of the code. They're very helpful for catching potential bugs, but they do also have false positives. This is one of those times.
Blindly following the reports of a static analyser 100% can sometimes lead to problems, in the same way as completely ignoring them. Context always has to be taken into account."

```
import moment from 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';

My moment version is the latest - `^2.27.0` - and my react-native version is `https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-38.0.2.tar.gz` (it's an expo project) which corresponds to `0.62.2`.

Since we need the react-native package manager to ""know"" that the file must be imported, we tried that style of import so that the Packager can ""see"" all files that have to be bundled in.

Ultimately, our import lines looked like this:

```typescript
import moment from ""moment"";
import ""moment/min/locales""; // Import all moment-locales -- it's just 400kb
import ""moment-timezone"";
```

The exact implementation of `require()` is injected by the runtime you're working with, and that's definitely something that behaves significantly differently between Debug & Release builds.

In react-native, there are also several different flavors of Release-mode JavaScript Bundling, including all-in-one-file, all-in-separate-files, and RAM Bundles. Each of these also change how require works. Debug `require()` connects to the [Metro Bundler](https://facebook.github.io/metro/) running on a local http server. This is probably is very similar to the webpack/jspm/other debug servers, which is probably why aliasing require doesn't cause problems in that environment."

A. Delete the `aliasedRequire` entirely if that's not how you're supposed to do things any more + tweak install instructions about it?
B. Detect react-native vs browser (`navigator` isn't available in react-native, but there are other techniques here), and behave differently depending on which situation we find ourselves in? eg. if react-native && DEV then print a console.error if the locale is theoretically supported, but hasn't been `required` yet (+ update docs).
C. Move the `aliasedRequire` from a local variable in that function to a ""semi-global"". `moment.aliasedRequire`, that way we could inject a no-op/do-nothing function so that `aliasedRequire` can't cause react-native to crash hard anymore."

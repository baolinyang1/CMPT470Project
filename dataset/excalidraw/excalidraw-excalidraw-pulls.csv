<p><em>Sourced from <a href=""https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/releases"">esbuild's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v0.25.0</h2>
<p><strong>This release deliberately contains backwards-incompatible changes.</strong> To avoid automatically picking up releases like this, you should either be pinning the exact version of <code>esbuild</code> in your <code>package.json</code> file (recommended) or be using a version range syntax that only accepts patch upgrades such as <code>^0.24.0</code> or <code>~0.24.0</code>. See npm's documentation about <a href=""https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/using-npm/semver/"">semver</a> for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict access to esbuild's development server (<a href=""https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99"">GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99</a>)</p>
<p>This change addresses esbuild's first security vulnerability report. Previously esbuild set the <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header to <code>*</code> to allow esbuild's development server to be flexible in how it's used for development. However, this allows the websites you visit to make HTTP requests to esbuild's local development server, which gives read-only access to your source code if the website were to fetch your source code's specific URL. You can read more information in <a href=""https://github.com/evanw/esbuild/security/advisories/GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99"">the report</a>.</p>
<p>Starting with this release, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS"">CORS</a> will now be disabled, and requests will now be denied if the host does not match the one provided to <code>--serve=</code>. The default host is <code>0.0.0.0</code>, which refers to all of the IP addresses that represent the local machine (e.g. both <code>127.0.0.1</code> and <code>192.168.0.1</code>). If you want to customize anything about esbuild's development server, you can <a href=""https://esbuild.github.io/api/#serve-proxy"">put a proxy in front of esbuild</a> and modify the incoming and/or outgoing requests.</p>
<p>In addition, the <code>serve()</code> API call has been changed to return an array of <code>hosts</code> instead of a single <code>host</code> string. This makes it possible to determine all of the hosts that esbuild's development server will accept.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/sapphi-red""><code>@​sapphi-red</code></a> for reporting this issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete output files when a build fails in watch mode (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3643"">#3643</a>)</p>
<p>It has been requested for esbuild to delete files when a build fails in watch mode. Previously esbuild left the old files in place, which could cause people to not immediately realize that the most recent build failed. With this release, esbuild will now delete all output files if a rebuild fails. Fixing the build error and triggering another rebuild will restore all output files again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix correctness issues with the CSS nesting transform (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3620"">#3620</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3877"">#3877</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3933"">#3933</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3997"">#3997</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/4005"">#4005</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4037"">#4037</a>, <a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/pull/4038"">#4038</a>)</p>
<p>This release fixes the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naive expansion of CSS nesting can result in an exponential blow-up of generated CSS if each nesting level has multiple selectors. Previously esbuild sometimes collapsed individual nesting levels using <code>:is()</code> to limit expansion. However, this collapsing wasn't correct in some cases, so it has been removed to fix correctness issues.</p>
<pre lang=""css""><code>/* Original code */
.parent {
  &gt; .a,
  &gt; .b1 &gt; .b2 {
    color: red;
  }
}
<p>/* Old output (with --supported:nesting=false) */<br />
.parent &gt; :is(.a, .b1 &gt; .b2) {<br />
color: red;<br />
}</p>
<p>/* New output (with --supported:nesting=false) */<br />
.parent &gt; .a,<br />
.parent &gt; .b1 &gt; .b2 {<br />
color: red;<br />
}<br />
</code></pre></p>
<p>Thanks to <a href=""https://github.com/tim-we""><code>@​tim-we</code></a> for working on a fix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>&amp;</code> CSS nesting selector can be repeated multiple times to increase CSS specificity. Previously esbuild ignored this possibility and incorrectly considered <code>&amp;&amp;</code> to have the same specificity as <code>&amp;</code>. With this release, this should now work correctly:</p>
<pre lang=""css""><code>/* Original code (color should be red) */
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<h1>Changelog: 2023</h1>
<p>This changelog documents all esbuild versions published in the year 2023 (versions 0.16.13 through 0.19.11).</p>
<h2>0.19.11</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fix TypeScript-specific class transform edge case (<a href=""https://redirect.github.com/evanw/esbuild/issues/3559"">#3559</a>)</p>
<p>The previous release introduced an optimization that avoided transforming <code>super()</code> in the class constructor for TypeScript code compiled with <code>useDefineForClassFields</code> set to <code>false</code> if all class instance fields have no initializers. The rationale was that in this case, all class instance fields are omitted in the output so no changes to the constructor are needed. However, if all of this is the case <em>and</em> there are <code>#private</code> instance fields with initializers, those private instance field initializers were still being moved into the constructor. This was problematic because they were being inserted before the call to <code>super()</code> (since <code>super()</code> is now no longer transformed in that case). This release introduces an additional optimization that avoids moving the private instance field initializers into the constructor in this edge case, which generates smaller code, matches the TypeScript compiler's output more closely, and avoids this bug:</p>
<pre lang=""ts""><code>// Original code
class Foo extends Bar {
  #private = 1;
  public: any;
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
}
<p>// Old output (with esbuild v0.19.9)<br />
class Foo extends Bar {<br />
constructor() {<br />
super();<br />
this.#private = 1;<br />
}<br />
#private;<br />
}</p>
<p>// Old output (with esbuild v0.19.10)<br />

9114,This ensures proper saving of collaboration data when users leave the room. Fixes #9104,"Fixes #9104 
fix: handle async operations in collaboration save

- Make queueSaveToFirebase throttled function async
- Remove unnecessary await on flush() call

After analyzing the code, I could see that there's an issue with how collaboration data is being saved. The problem occurs because the data is not being properly saved when a collaborator leaves the room. so i fixed it by modifying the stopCollaboration method in Collab.tsx to ensure data is properly saved before a user leaves.

I've made the following changes to fix the issue:
1. Made the stopCollaboration method asynchronous by adding the async keyword to properly handle promises.
2. Added await to saveCollabRoomToFirebase call to ensure it completes before proceeding.
3.Added a call to queueSaveToFirebase.flush() with await before destroying the socket client to ensure any pending changes are saved

I've made the following additional changes:
1.In ShareDialog.tsx, updated the stopCollaboration call to use .then() to handle the async operation properly.
2.In App.tsx, added await to both stopCollaboration calls and made the containing function async where needed.

These changes ensure that:
1.When a user leaves the room, their changes are properly saved to Firebase before the connection is closed
2.Any pending changes in the queue are flushed and saved before destroying the socket client


This ensures proper saving of collaboration data when users leave the room.

9088,feat: Add automated accessibility testing with Axe-core and Playwright,"This pull request introduces automated accessibility testing to the Excalidraw project, leveraging Axe-core and Playwright.

**Importance of Accessibility Monitoring:**

In today's digital landscape, ensuring accessibility is not merely a technical consideration but a fundamental principle of inclusivity. Accessibility testing plays a crucial role in identifying and rectifying barriers that prevent individuals with disabilities from fully engaging with and benefiting from digital content. By proactively monitoring accessibility, we create a more equitable and user-friendly environment for everyone, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities.

**Benefits of Automated Accessibility Testing:**

- **Early Issue Detection:** Automated accessibility tests, integrated into the development workflow, enable early detection of accessibility issues, preventing them from propagating into production and becoming more costly to fix.
- **Increased Efficiency:** Automated testing streamlines the accessibility evaluation process, saving valuable time and resources compared to manual assessments.
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Automated tools can systematically scan web pages and identify a wide range of potential accessibility violations, ensuring more thorough coverage than manual testing alone.
- **Continuous Improvement:** By incorporating accessibility testing into the CI/CD pipeline, we foster a culture of continuous improvement, where accessibility is consistently evaluated and addressed throughout the development lifecycle.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Ultimately, automated accessibility testing leads to a better user experience for everyone, including individuals with disabilities, by ensuring that digital content is usable, navigable, and understandable.

**Implementation Details:**

- The tests are implemented using Axe-core and Playwright, two widely adopted and reliable tools for accessibility testing.
- The tests are integrated into the GitHub Actions workflow, ensuring they are automatically executed on every pull request and push to the master branch.
- The workflow file is located at `.github/workflows/accessibility-check.yml`.
- The accessibility test script is located at `scripts/accessibility-test.js`.
- The generated accessibility report is uploaded as an artifact for review.

9086,perf: Improved pointer events related performance when the sidebar is docked with a large library open,"When the sidebar is docked with a sufficiently large library open, there is some perceptible lag and choppiness during canvas interaction. This PR aims to improve performance and UX in this scenario.

My first impulse + our offline discussion led me to investigate any unnecessary re-renders. Something that both `LibraryMenu` and `LibraryMenuContent` are guilty of. By memoizing both components, I managed to mitigate this. With it, I also improved the `pending elements calculation`, as in the current version, rotation and resizing do not update the preview element correctly. These optimizations helped somewhat, but did not fully resolve the performance issue.

My next thought was that it might be the large number of (potentially) complex SVGs in the sidebar that may be the culprit. One approach I tried was lazy loading them with `IntersectionObserver`. The idea was to only insert the currently visible ones into the DOM. This showed some promise and definitely seemed to result in noticeably improved performance, but it still did not match the sidebar-less version.

However, this detour helped me identify the real bottleneck. I noticed that although pointer events no longer triggered React re-renders, there was still some unusual behavior. After some more investigation, I found that the App component frequently changes the `--ui-pointerEvent` CSS variable to block other elements' interactivity, and applying these changes was the root cause of the lags.

My proposed solution is to remove these changes while maintaining the same UX (i.e., no interaction with outside elements during canvas interaction). During a canvas pointer up event, we capture the pointer events to the canvas itself. This ensures that all other outside elements will be non-interactive until a pointer up event. I tested this solution and it provides the same UX as before, though there could be some edge cases I'm not aware of. Unfortunately, I have noticed the tests are failing because `pepjs`, the library that polyfills pointer events to `jsdom` does not properly support the capturing phase for pointer events. Still, I think this idea is worth considering at least.

9064,fix: fonts not loading on export (again),"Fixes #8296 (again)

Also fixes non-latin characters being correctly loaded & rendered during export (extended latin, CJK, etc.).

The core of the issue was the second param of `document.fonts.check`, which can't be empty string `""""`, otherwise the check is always true and fonts never load! It also cannot be just `undefined`, as then `document.fonts.load` won't load all necessary font faces (it could load just one irrelevant font-face containing latin chars, even though the text element contains CJK or extended latin character like `š`). Therefore we are always gathering all unique characters per used family (in the given elements), which will force `document.font.load` to load exactly what we need.

Right click drag is crucial for effective one-handed editing and matches functionality of numerous other popular canvas-based apps mentioned above. Not to mention not all the mice that don't have middle buttons or middle buttons that don't (many cases in macOS) work or are set to other actions.

I am unsure of the protocol for updating all of the languages (hence why I just updated [en.json](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/packages/excalidraw/locales/en.json)) nor do I know what sounds good for the copy for the drag hint at the top so please give some suggestions.

There are two types of perf optimizations that we can make to frames:
- rendering optimizations
- operation optimizations

This PR addresses the first kind by reducing the number of unnecessary frame clippings in the render step, which is quite expensive. To elaborate,
- if an individual element is completely in a frame, there's no need to apply clipping to it
- if an element is completely outside the frame, but is part of a group that has some elements that should be clipped, then it should be clipped as well

8952,feat: Elbow arrow segment fixing & positioning,"![380760733-c5004ca1-e626-4967-a953-f85a0269f4bf](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9de2f2d2-b81e-4492-ac99-26ea480459b9)

## What's in this PR?
- Main goal was to allow manual positioning of elbow arrow segments on either horizontal or vertical direction (depending on its original heading)
- The movement of segments happen via showing a control knob at every segment midpoint, reusing the idiom from editable linear elements
- Secondary goal was to keep the modified segment unchanged, except the directional displacement (so the length of the moved segment is fixed)
- The fixed segments can be ""released"" when double clicking on the hollow control know at the middle of the segment
- Additionally this PR consolidates all elbow arrow modification into `mutateElement()` so the complexity is hidden for other developers.
- This PR also bring a fix for ""misaligned"" but very close parallel segments, avoiding a visual glitch

## Key implementation details
- `packages/excalidraw/element/routing.ts` is renamed to `packages/excalidraw/element/elbowarrow.ts`
- The `LinearElementEditor` class contains handlers for segment midpoint logic, but due to a likely state mismatch / race condition a completely new midpoint handling was implemented for elbow arrows.
- Elbow arrow creation and updates needed different inputs, so the `LinearElementEditor::movePoints()` function was extensively updated to cover both elbow arrows and simple arrows.
- Due to a UX requirement where an elbow arrow is bound on both ends and the second segment is fixed, then the start (or end) of the arrow is dragged to a perpendicular side of the bound element, there are two new properties on elbow arrow elements, `startIsSpecial` and `endIsSpecial` respectively.
![a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae0cfaae-17ed-4f9c-bd5e-51851993c61e)

- To store the fixed segments data on the elbow arrow elements a new property is introduced, called `fixedSegments`. It is an array of objects, the objects contain 
	- a segment index, which is the point index of the last point of a fixed segment in the `points` property (so it goes from 1 to length -1)
	- start, which is the element `LocalPoint` coordinate of the start of the fixed segment
	- end, which is the element `LocalPoint` coordinate of the end of the fixed segment
- The elbow arrow generating algorithm on its own creates suboptimal arrow points with duplicates and hooks, which are simplified in a post processing step. This simplification results in loss of information for subsequent modification requests, so there are a lot of subtle heuristics to ""guess"" the lost information, which would be required to keep a stable visual experience.
- The visual debugging is enhanced and refactored to make development easier (beyond elbow arrows)

## Where to start a review
### elbowarrow.ts
- Start with reviewing the fist half of `packages/excalidraw/element/elbowarrow.ts`. The code in this file is organized around a single main entrypoint, `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)`. This is called from `mutateElement(...)` to calculate the changes needed, then returns the element updates required in the form of `ElementUpdate<ExcalidrawElbowArrowElement>`, which is then woven into the original logic of `mutateElement(...)`
- The `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)` function is a dispatch function to handle 6 different use cases individually.
- The original elbow arrow routing code is refactored into two separate functions, which are almost identical to the original code: `getElbowArrowData(...)` which just calculates the common parameters used by all the functions and `routeElbowArrow(...)` which contain the routing algorithm. The modifications in these compared to the original is minimal, only affecting spacing around bound elements.

### mutateElement.ts
- This contains the call to `updateElbowArrowPoints(...)` in `elbowarrow.ts` as a separate branch before the original code. This branch prepares the function arguments required for the elbow arrow code, then applies the resolved changes before handing over the control flow to the old code.
- Due to the fact that elbow arrows need additional information in some use cases, a new optional `options` argument is added to the interface of `mutateElement(...)` which affects the public API.

### LinearElementEditor.ts
- Beyond the changes to `movePoints(...)` there are small modifications to the original code to handle elbow arrows
- Additional functions introduced to cover the new use cases, `moveFixedSegment(...)` and `deleteFixedSegment(...)`
- There are helper functions added to support these two main use case covering functions, which are also called from `components/App.tsx` handlers.

### packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx
- A new segment midpoint handler code is introduced due to the previously mentioned state handling bug
- These modifications also hook into the segment movement and delete functions in `LinearElementEditor`.
- Due to the special needs of elbow arrows, there are modifications to resize, flip, drag and restore functionalities for the elements (`dragElement.ts`, `resizeElement.ts`and `restore.ts`

### fractionalIndex.ts
- Due to the change in calling signature of `mutateElement(...)` changes were needed in `syncInvalidIndices(...)` and `syncMovedIndices(...)`",closed,2024-12-26T09:30:29Z,2025-01-17T17:07:03Z,2025-01-17T17:07:03Z,,master,feat/elbow-segment-move,30,3203,1690,30,3,0,"dwelle, dwelle, dwelle, dwelle, mtolmacs, mtolmacs, mtolmacs, dwelle","COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, APPROVED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8952

### Description
Previously when we saved excalidraw file and reloaded the page, we had to again save the file to disk.

The issue was caused by the selection element fitting the frame bounds without considering the name; when trying to drag a selected frame the `hitElement` function was returning `false` leading to no object being dragged, because the mouse point wasn't in the selection box.

Adds a render function for a custom JSX element in the top left corner.  It renders to the right of the main menu trigger.

    - If the custom JSX is set to render in the mobile view, the rendering occurs in the `mobile-misc-tools-container` in `packages/excalidraw/components/MobileMenu.tsx`
 - A few small style updates  
   - Accommodation for the JSX element being added to the `App-menu_top__left`
   - A small update to fix the weird spacing of the undo/redo action buttons in the mobile view when nothing is selected
     - Adjusted button size to meet [WCAG 2.2 :: SC 2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum) (Level AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/target-size-minimum.html)

8901,fix: Flush pending DOM updates before .focus(),"fixes #8840

**Questions**
- ~Could we do even better? (without forcing sync update). We likely don't want all functions on the DOM elements to wait for `flushSync`.~ unsure, we would need to find out what is the intermediate step causing this, but there are no usable chrome logs when running in debug
- ~Why is the container not yet fully mounted (might be non-intentional)?~ seems mounted in the DOM, but still crashes
- ~Why does it happen only on Chromium & macOS?~ might be some specific chromium bug (does not crash in newer 132.0.6796.0), though didn't find anything similar reported (weird)
- ~Why does not React automatically queue the call instead of crashing in the middle?~ likely for better granularity / control, though IMO it shouldn't just crash the tab

8895,fix: fixed image transparency by adding alpha option to preserve image alpha channel,"Fixes: #8792

The issue is that the `image-blob-reduce` library relies on a `pica` version that has to specify the `alpha` option to preserve the alpha channel. Specifically the `reduce.toBlob(file, options)` function, should have an `alpha: true` option.

8892,feat: allow show grid without snap to grid (#6889),"This PR adds a feature to allowing showing the grid without snapping things to the grid and thus implements #6889.

## Notes

- Though I have experience programming, I am not familiar with react and typescript, so let me know there are ways I should improve this code.

- This is missing translations for anything other than English.

- Naming: I used appropriate variations of ""show grid"" for fields and UI elements to try to make clear the distinction from the current ""grid mode"".  I'm not sure if we want to rename ""grid mode"" or ""show grid"" to make the distinction more obvious.

- In the long run, it might make sense to refactor the current ""grid mode"" (which both shows and snaps to grid) into orthogonal ""show grid"" (this PR) and ""snap to grid"" (not currently implemented).  The current ""grid mode"" then maybe becomes a convenience to toggle both simultaneously.  I did not do that in this PR for a few reasons.  First, I don't know what the policies are on UI and API stability.  Second, the interactions between the current grid mode and snap to objects mode would have to be refactored/redesigned.  Third, maintaining development velocity and avoiding getting bogged down in design debates and PR purgatory, since ""show grid"" is a feature I have current uses for.

8890,fix: localStorage overflow and add new toast types,"## Fixing Local Storage Overflow
I fixed an issue where users don't get a warning when they exceed the total storage limit. Resolves #8805. I removed the overflow error from the console in favor of a toast.

![fix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74c976ea-3ef5-4278-ba58-25616abfd650)

The toast is triggered when the storage capacity is exceeded. After this point, saving is disabled until the user deletes some items.

Initially, I wanted to trigger this at 97% storage capacity. I created a utility function to estimate the usage by summing up the lengths of keys and values. However, it was being called too frequently, and I couldn't find an effective way to memoize it. I ended up just triggering the toast when the error triggers instead.

I did write my error message in `en.json` locale file, which I'm assuming was the right place to put it? Should I open a new issue to get it added to Crowdin?

## New Toast Types

I also expanded the toasting system slightly to include different types of messages. I hovered on the close icon for these screenshots to show the close icon hover color. All colors are from the main theme.

**Message** (Default existing toast)

8884,fix: elbow arrow endpoint drag with Ctrl held does not snap but tries to select,"### What?
- Fixed bug such that when an elbow arrow endpoint is dragged with Ctrl (or any other) key, it will snap to the grid as originally intended and the selection box will no longer appear.
- Resolves issue #8761 

### Why?
- Identified as bug with existing open issue that we wanted to resolve.
- Noticed snapping logic for elbow arrow was missing.
- Noticed in the `maybeHandleResize` function, there was a case specifically that made this function return false for elbow arrows but true for other arrows/objects. The difference in this return value is what caused the selection box to appear for the elbow arrow but not the other arrows. This was originally because there was an intent to not resize for elbow arrows (there was a comment labeled `\\ Elbow arrows cannot be transformed (resized or rotated).` with the associated conditional statement we found). However, we removed this line of code to ensure that elbow arrows can still return true from the `maybeHandleResize` function, hence preventing the selection box to appear. After removal, the original intention of not wanting elbow arrows to be resized of rotated was still held via user testing, so we found the line to be unnecessary and resolved the selection box bug. 

### How?
- Refactored code from `App.tsx` into functions `handlePointDragging` and `_getShiftLockedDelta` in `packages/excalidraw/element/linearElementEditor.ts` to include snapping functionality for elbowArrows. The edits to`handlePointDragging` mutates the element into a straight line on right angles, and the edits made to `_getShiftLockedDelta` calculates the snapping angle under an `isElbowArrow` condition.
-  Asked in Excalidraw Discord developer community for where the selection box creation handler occurred. Located this in the `packages/excalidraw/components/App.tsx` file and kept commenting out code/printing log statements until locating the root cause of the issue in the `maybeHandleResize` function.

### Testing?
- User tested via locally hosted Excalidraw on Chrome browser using Mac. Bug fixes were successful on 4 different users who tested as so. The extent of the user testing is described below:
- We dragged the endpoint of various elbow arrows while periodically holding down the Ctrl (or any other random) key to make sure it would snap to the grid layout and that the selection box did not appear. Additionally, we made sure this snapping behavior still works for the other arrow types as before and that the selection box still works as before when the cursor is held down on the canvas. Furthermore, we made sure that the elbow arrow still did not resize or rotate as originally intended when it is included in a selection box.
- Ran `yarn test` to make sure all current Excalidraw tests still passed.


### Screen Recording
First 3 seconds is dragging endpoint without holding Ctrl key. Remaining is holding Ctrl key and displayed snapping movement and removal of selection box

8851,fix: fixed search input cursor position issue,"This PR is to fixed this issue #8847 .

the issue only happen in here: 
component path:  `packages/excalidraw/components/SearchMenu.tsx`
```javascript
  if (event.key === KEYS.ARROW_UP) {
    event.stopPropagation();
    stableState.goToPreviousItem();
  }
```

Reason: It may be that the `goToPreviousItem` function changes the focusIndex state, and then the cursor position is updated before the input re-render.

So，we must make the input cursor change after input component re-render. `requestAnimationFrame` is a good way to change input cursor  before redraw, reflow.
```javascript
  const fixInputCursorPosition = () => {
    requestAnimationFrame(() => {
      const searchInput = searchInputRef.current;
      const isFocus = document.activeElement === searchInput;
      // if input is not focus and input instance is not exist return
      if (!searchInput || !isFocus) {
        return;
      }
      const cursorPosition = searchInput.selectionStart;
      const textLength = searchInput.value.length!;
      if (cursorPosition !== textLength) {
        searchInput.setSelectionRange(textLength, textLength);
      }
    });
  };
  ```
  
  

after fixed， the position of input cursor is correct. and keep on the end of input value.
but you can move cursor by keyboard or mouse as well

- **Feature**: Adds a search bar to the Libraries feature, allowing users to filter library items by name as they type in a search query.
- **Usage**: The search input dynamically filters the displayed items, helping users find specific components more quickly, especially within larger libraries.
- **Implementation**:
  - Utilized useMemo for optimized filtering of library items based on the current search query.
  - Included case-insensitive matching for more user-friendly searches.
- **Benefits**:
  - Improves user experience by making it easier to find components within published libraries.
  - Reduces time spent scrolling through extensive libraries, especially for users who frequently reuse specific components.

8770,fix: load env vars correctly and set debug and linter flags to false explicitly in prod mode,"The `build:preview` `start:production` scripts has been hanging recently on my machine. On further debugging I found that its the `vite build` script that hangs and thats due to the `eslint` script in the `vite-plugin-checker`

I still need to debug why the `eslint` script hangs the build, probably it takes too much time to run and eventually hangs. But nevertheless this script is for dev mode so we shouldn't be running it in production build.

This script shouldn't ideally run in production mode since it depends on an env variable `VITE_APP_ENABLE_ESLINT` which is not set in `.env.production`, however when logging the envVars this variable was logged as `true`. 

There were 2 reasons why the variable was set to `true`
1. We are loading the env vars without specifying the mode and this loads the `.env.local` file always
```
const envVars = loadEnv('', `../`);

```
So I started passing the `mode` to the above function to ensure that `.env.production` is loaded when running `vite build`

2. After the above fix also the variable `VITE_APP_ENABLE_ESLINT` is still set to true, and the reason being`vite` always loads the `.env.local` file and merges it with env specific vars if any.

Hence to ensure the debug and linter variables are never set to true, I am setting them explicitly to false in `.env.production`",closed,2024-11-07T08:16:09Z,2024-11-07T21:14:49Z,2024-11-07T21:14:49Z,,master,aakansha/build,2,219,210,3,3,0,dwelle,APPROVED,False,https://api.github.com/repos/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8770
8768,Add double-click functionality to PlusIcon in LibraryUnit,"## Description
Added double-click detection and handling functionality to the LibraryUnit component. This enhancement allows for more intuitive user interactions with library items.

### Changes made:
- Added new `onDoubleClick` prop to LibraryUnit component
- Implemented click tracking logic with timing detection
- Added double-click handling while preserving existing single-click functionality
- Applied double-click support to both adder and dragger elements

### Implementation details:
- Uses click count and timestamp tracking to detect double-clicks
- Double-click threshold set to 300ms

### Testing:
- [x] Tested single click functionality still works as expected
- [x] Tested double-click detection works correctly
- [x] Verified mobile compatibility
- [x] Checked existing functionality is not broken

Might re-introduce a smarter version once we have `italics`, i.e. based on `actual width - advance width`. Once there, we shall also investigate, how to keep the padding-like buffer, as we need to keep the width as advance width due to wrapping.

We could probably also just remove the padding once the text starts to overflow. However, the whole behavior of overflowing WYSIWYG is not ideal.

The core of the fix is rather simple: we need to normalize SVG string of images being added to the editor (`props.initialData`/`ExcalidrawAPI.addFiles`) because since image cropping (https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/pull/8613) we're relying on correct image `naturalWidth`/`naturalHeight` which we parse from `<svg>` `viewBox` if it's not set natively on the `<svg>` element.

Old images stored previously weren't being normalized necessarily, or if the image added to the editor has `DataURL` encoded from a different source other than the Excalidraw editor.

---

The rest of the PR boilerplate is allowing for this restoring to take place. 

- we needed a sync version of `getDataURL()` to not change API too much.

    As part of this, I made some encoder/decoder functions sync as well.
- introduced optional image file versioning (`BinaryFileData.version`) so that host apps can decide whether they want to re-persist images after potential SVG string normalization",closed,2024-10-29T15:39:28Z,2024-10-29T21:40:25Z,2024-10-29T21:40:25Z,,master,dwelle/restore-svg-images,13,196,94,2,3,0,zsviczian,APPROVED,False,https://api.github.com/repos/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8730

8720,fix: Ensure new flowchart nodes match properties of the starting node,"This update ensures that new flowchart nodes created in the application match the properties of the starting node. By introducing a utility function for node creation, we maintain consistency in attributes such as dimensions, styling, and opacity across all flowchart nodes.

This improvement enhances the visual integrity of flowcharts and ensures that the behavior of new nodes is predictable.

Fixes: #8672 
Ensures new flowchart nodes maintain consistent properties with the starting node, improving visual coherence.

8719,feat: prevent unwanted movements of elements on selection,"issue: https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/8713

This PR addresses the issue of elements moving unintentionally when selected by adding a slight buffer on initial selection. This buffer prevents small, accidental movements when beginning to interact with an element.

Once the element crosses a defined movement threshold, the buffer is fully removed, allowing unrestricted, precise movement without further interference.

8693,fix: load font faces in Safari manually,"Safari does not always trigger ""loadingdone"" event (actually it rarely does) and thus in most cases we end up with unloaded fonts on init and paste. It's especially annoying when there are tons of font faces to load, such as with the recent CJK support and half or even less characters remain unloaded.

The solution is loading all the necessary font faces manually in Safari, both on init and when pasting elements.

Fixes https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/3229

_Other improvements_
- Consolidates font faces logic in export under the `Fonts` class
- Concurrently loads 10 font faces at a time (loading all 250 font faces at the same time likely isn't a good idea)

_TODO_
- [x] Regression test export
- [x] Double-check font faces are not loaded twice or more times
- [x] Double-check we don't load font faces which shouldn't be loaded
- [x] Load only font faces for pasted elements

8649,fix: undo/redo action for international keyboard layouts,"This PR fixes #8003 

Main idea is that it is probably incorrect to use actual keys when detecting undo and redo actions, because some languages does not have `Z` or `Y` letters in their layouts. For example, in some cyrillic layouts there is letter `Я` instead of `Z`. `event.key` for it is `Я` and `event.code` is `KeyZ`. Because of this I believe key codes should be used instead of actual keys.

I'm stil figuring out how to fix tests for this change, so PR is in draft mode. I will appreciate if contributors that are more familiar with this project will look at my approach while I'm doing this.

- unified prod font paths across `excalidraw-app`, OSS package (host apps, examples, E+), and CDN into `fonts/[FontFamilyName]/[FontFamilyName]-*.woff2`
  - grouping into subfolders per font family ✅
  - unification of `EXCALIDRAW_ASSET_PATH` for OSS and E+ ✅ (instead of one relying on ""/"" while the other on ""/fonts/"")
  - unified and organized `excalidraw-app/build` & `excalidraw/dist/prod/` into `fonts/` folder ✅ (instead of having all on root)

  - host apps can just copy the whole ""fonts"" folder instead of all the woff2 files ✅
- split all non-deprecated fonts into multiple chunks (atm only Excalifont and Comic Shanns left) and related:
  - stopped adding vite `-[hash]` suffix to fonts on `excalidraw-app` build (we have hashes thanks to the split)
  - optimized fetch during export to force cache
- stopped preloading Virgil, as at this point it's unnecessary for new scenes, while old scenes will mostly get it from the cache or just fetch it on init if needed

8632,Feat/choosen shape on click,"I modified handleCanvasPointerUp, handleCanvasPointerDown, handleCanvasPointerMove to let the canvas create a shape depending on the selected tool, the user has selected before. There is also a small treshold (5px). I left comments within the code, so that you can hopefully better understand my thinking. Here is a short summary, but the comments in the code hopefully make it more clear:

I added a new variable (pointerDownPosition) to track the initial pointer down position in the handleCanvasPointerUp function. This should happen right before the pointer up event actually takes action so that we can compare this value with the new pointer up position. Left some note about clientY just for clarification. It can be deleted later on.

Then I calculate the distance moved during the inital pointer down position to the new pointer up position.

I had problems with the addElement Function, which i introduced here inside of the handleCanvasPointerUp function. Initally, I tried to find an already existing function for adding a single element in the codebase, but could only find one for adding more elements and then I decided to write a new one here just for adding the single shape. If there is already one, rather use that one. Also I was not sure about the objectstructure and its allowed types in the newElement object. It should contain the key value pairs of the created shape, but I only wrote a draft and commented some things out, which i was not so sure about. 

At the end, the new state must be set (not implemented yet).

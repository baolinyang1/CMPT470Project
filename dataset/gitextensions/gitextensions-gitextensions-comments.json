The commit window can be closed with <kbd>ESC</kbd>, no need to kill the app.\r\n\r\nFrom your description the 2nd monitor is your primary monitor. I believe I've observed a similar behaviour in multi monitor setups (I don't have one any longer)."

I think a better solution, if ensuring saved coordinates always landing into screen area is too difficult, is to allow the form to appear in taskbar, with it's own preview, so it would be easier to recover it."

        "Comment Body": "In my humble opinion, i think that saving just \"X,Y\" origin coordinate is not enough, also the monitor ID where it is saved is important. As a workaround, the function to understand if the form will be out of screen or not, have flaws. It detect the form *CAN* be displayed even if it can not. So the window will appear offscreen, but without any cue icon in the taskbar it is impossible to move. \r\nOf course pressing ESC will close the window, now user can move the main form into the *OTHER* monitor, and in this case commit form will appear again to screen (because the main form is now on the same screen where the child form has been saved before).\r\n\r\n"

I tried even re-installing Git Extensions, but that didn't help either. \r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed the above trick (by moving the main window to the smaller laptop screen and after that press the commit button) worked! So I can let you know that this \"bug\" is still active in 4.1.0.16698 release.\r\n\r\nThanks for a great product."

I am aware of the TODOs.\r\n\r\n`TreeView` has several limitations, particularly icons:\r\n`StateImages` are limited to 14 (only a runtime error when trying to use a higher index). `StateImages` are scaled in a special way.\r\n`Images` work better. But it looks ugly if some nodes have no icon.\r\nWith `OwnerDrawAll`, one needs to draw everything including tree lines, which feels like implementing the tree view control from scratch, what I do not want to do.\r\n\r\nTooltips are automatically provided - if `Text` matches the owner-drawn length. I saw the wrong selection highlight length, too. I am adapting this.\r\n\r\n> Should changed submodules be in modified status group? Now they are separated.\r\n\r\n\"Sort by status\" is a TODO yet and should yield the same ordering as before. New subgroups or changes in the ordering should be added in a follow-up.\r\n\r\n> Separate the flat/tree setting?\r\n\r\nI prefer a one-stop shop. A \"tree / flat\" toggle could be useful in addition.\r\nLater, we should add a toolbar with sort options and filtering.\r\nFormCommit and artificial commits could use a separate sorting setting."

But it would be much effort for little benefit.\r\n\r\nMulti-selection works with `Ctrl+click` and `Shift+click`. (`Ctrl+A` works the same as before.)\r\nAt least with #12149, I do not see much need for or value in features like\r\n- be able to have **no** selection\r\n- select multiple entries **from bottom** with the mouse\r\n  With #12149, just select a diff group or a folder and operate on all contained items.\r\n  It should not be too difficult to add a generic click and drag for selecting multiple files - to `MultiSelectTreeView`.\r\n  (Though changing the focused node on mouse down is hard to achieve with `TreeView`.)"

        "Comment Body": "I have no need to defend the change, but I guess I will explain why I prefer it this way.\r\nEverything can be improved.\r\nIt is possible to change the behavior back to the 3.5 so when opening separate instances, they use the FileHistory.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6248932/148295394-6f9f59e6-2a1a-47d7-92fe-d47a01adc8fb.png)\r\n\r\nI want to set FileHistory as deprecated, remove it at some point together with other forms like Compare.\r\nThis is quite some extra code to maintain.\r\n\r\nNote that FileHistory (both before and in master) can be used to show history for several files or folders.\r\n\r\n>     1. Before it was a clearly identifiable different view. Now it's difficult to distinguish to a normal instance\r\n\r\nHow to make this clearer? \r\nSuggestion in next question.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I hardly use the extra instance, just filters in current Browse (`F` in Diff/Tree) then clear the filter (`Shift-Ctrl-F` in grid).\r\n \r\n>     2. There is a lot less space to see the diff and blame. And you always have to move the split separator. Sometimes a diff was difficult to read, so now that you can't see the whole file and have a blame view, it will be worst :(\r\n\r\nSome shortcut to collapse the left panel as well as the FileStatusList?\r\n(Could be default when open with file filter).\r\n\r\n>     3. You loose the \"View\" tab (that I sometimes I preferred to use because I found the blame aggressive when you move your mouse and the grey selection change)\r\n\r\nThe \"filtered file\" is preselected in Diff/Tree.\r\nYou can view the file instead of blame in Tree tab with `B` (as well as Blame in Diff).\r\n\r\n>     4. You no more are able to identify quickly which instance is file history (and when you want to switch quickly and often during an investigation or when you want to clean the instances opened, its a pain) lost in all similar windows\r\n> I think we need to reproduce this behavior (ie. changing the title of the application) when the \"Path filter\" is enabled\r\n\r\nThe title is already adjusted when there is a file filter, FileHistory could be added too. Or just put the filtered path name first?\r\n\r\n>     5. Maybe when we open a new instance to enable the \"Path filter\", the left panel should be hidden\r\n\r\nSee 2.\r\n\r\n>     6. I don't know if it make sense also to filter the file list also\r\n\r\nThe file is preselected, also when you change commit (unless you select a file that is in the newly selected commit too), so I do not see a need here.\r\nIf something, add the file status list filter.\r\n \r\n>     7. Perf: It takes more time to open the file history in another window. And because it's a full GitExtension instance, it also fetch in background if enable, do the `git status` that could take a lot of CPU on big repositories.\r\n\r\nWith the repo loading tweaks in master, I find opening Browse similar to FileHistory before.\r\n(Also not using separate instances much.)\r\n\r\n>     8. Q: Is there a possibility to open the old window? I though we would keep it...\r\n\r\nSee above, but I would like to prepare to remove.\r\n\r\n>     9. I'm pretty sure the \"Filtering\" icon is not enough visible for legacy user that will have it enabled when doing \"File History\" as usual (and that we will have some issues opened). And a dropdown menu (like the stash button) to disable quickly the filters could be an improvement...\r\n\r\nDropdown for Advanced filter would be nice.\r\n(I settled with implementing the shortcut eventually, there were too much going on.)\r\n\r\n>     10. When blame is enabled, it's strange the way to come back to the \"diff\" view. You need to click again on the file.\r\n\r\nMy intention was that you only do the blame temporary that you go to FileTree for longer term blame.\r\nI find this convenient.\r\n\r\n>     11. When you use \"Blame this revision\" or \"Blame previous revision\", you come back to the diff view\r\n>         ![blame](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/460196/148285926-6be2f99e-eff3-43be-9cae-dac37f054b56.gif)\r\n\r\nThat could be changed.\r\n\r\n>     12. Q: Where are all these options:\r\n>         ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/460196/148283985-bd1984d4-1715-44b8-9a17-03116141a7ab.png)\r\n\r\nShould be added to Settings\r\n\r\n>     13. When you are in blame but you change the commit selected, you switch to the diff (I think that's the problem) even if  the blame icon is still enabled.\r\n\r\nSame as 11, all changes go back to diff."

The blame icon should have been reset here (or keep blame until another file is selected...)\r\n\r\nMaybe when we select another file, it could be acceptable to display the diff but when we select another revision, use the \"Blame this revision\" or \"Blame previous revision\", we **must** stay in blame mode. And yes the state of the icon should well reflect the current state so there is at least a bug to fix here.\r\n\r\n13b. Another thing linked here: In the file history, the revision grid is filtered on the file you blame. I think we should keep this behavior. That would allow the user to change the selected revision easily otherwise when clicking in a revision, you left the blame mode (especially if the commit has not changes on this file) which break the user workflow."

I prefer Blame here so the functionality can be discovered."

Double clicking the blame text should not switch to another revision - even never regardless of any mode IMO. Double clicking the gutter is the far clearer trigger."

Or do we take the risk of a quick v5.2.1?\r\n> \r\n> Do we have anything for a .1 release?\r\n\r\nI meant we should release a v5.2 with the bug fixes #12122 & #12129 and, optionally, with the low-risk feature #12023 (used for several months; and we have a fallback: the much slower ConEmu).\r\nMost of Gerhard's refactoring PRs are pretty safe for merging before v5.2.\r\nBut this PR changes a lot and does not work well for FormCommit yet. So, there would be a risk that we would quickly need to release 5.2.1 if it causes more side-effects.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate a soon release of v5.2. Then we could switch to .NET 9 and merge the fresh features (theming, tree view) and let them mature and be extended."

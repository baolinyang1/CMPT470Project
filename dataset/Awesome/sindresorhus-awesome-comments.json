You come to no-login-web-apps repo, look up the index and quickly find something that works for you, out of the box. No logins, no registrations. Of course, if you will be doing this too often, you might want to create an account on that site.\r\n\r\n> I honestly rather create an account in a great web app then use a crappy one without login\r\n\r\n**From README:** Most of the apps mentioned here do provide some kind of a user account feature to save history and progress. But as already stated before, a user account is not necessary to use the main features of these apps.\r\n\r\nMaybe I should add a marker for sites that allow logins ?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nConsidering the above explanation, I think my PR is suitable for this project. @sindresorhus What do you think?

My list is for free apps that means the app can be open-source or closed source. The listen only contains the best free apps that can have their source code public or private.\r\n\r\nI put it in three topics as the list covers windows, mac and linux. There are no free app lists currently, so I made one."

It seems there's definitely a desire for a \"gratis\" apps list, regardless the freedom of the source code. Still, I think adding it in one category only suffices.. All other \"free apps\" related lists are in `Miscellaneous` (apart from the macOS one, for obvious reasons)."

I mean that creating a single repository to include all the FOSS Alternatives is somehow a \"utopia\". In fact all of the Awesome lists included on this project are (kind of) FOSS related.\r\n2) Even if the No1 is not correct the list is too poor to be an \"awesome\". It misses known entries.\r\n3) The sections are too generic. This is due to No1 above. For example the section \"System Services\" (where you mention Mobile App repository services) should be named \"Digital software distribution platform\".\r\n4) The sections are not in alphabetical order so navigating through them is too hard to accomplish.\r\n5) There are already similar Awesome lists (some of them are also included on this project): \r\n - https://github.com/RunaCapital/awesome-oss-alternatives\r\n - https://github.com/tvvocold/FOSS-for-Dev\r\n - https://github.com/sfermigier/awesome-foss-alternatives\r\n"

I believe it uses an asterisk instead of a dash as a marker.\r\n"

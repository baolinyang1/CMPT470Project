        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

GE may calculate the color to be white, this is a an override to avoid the low contrast without risking breaking other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/11843#issue-2473084897\r\neven if that issue is about something related.\r\nI cannot reproduce, this is a good enough default configuration as theming is limited anyway.\r\n(and colors can be overridden with git-config)\r\n\r\nNote that colors set as \"black brightyellow\" instead of \"black yellow bold\" as that has a separate meaning - a separate PR will clarify.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\nwhite foreground is configured in debugger, cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f137997-fb5d-4b52-b925-832c1df12aa0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7303c7a-8b34-4cdb-af32-e349d0afd3ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd004c3e-6f4f-4f7e-a49e-7749801c8370)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44acb6-eba6-4835-a338-9ec1bfa87255)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31223b74-4458-4bcd-b11a-5b6c0c88a92e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301d5c6-b7f6-4b94-9a10-e64fd74ef3a9)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

GE may calculate the color to be white, this is a an override to avoid the low contrast without risking breaking other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/11843#issue-2473084897\r\neven if that issue is about something related.\r\nI cannot reproduce, this is a good enough default configuration as theming is limited anyway.\r\n(and colors can be overridden with git-config)\r\n\r\nNote that colors set as \"black brightyellow\" instead of \"black yellow bold\" as that has a separate meaning - a separate PR will clarify.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\nwhite foreground is configured in debugger, cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f137997-fb5d-4b52-b925-832c1df12aa0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7303c7a-8b34-4cdb-af32-e349d0afd3ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd004c3e-6f4f-4f7e-a49e-7749801c8370)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44acb6-eba6-4835-a338-9ec1bfa87255)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31223b74-4458-4bcd-b11a-5b6c0c88a92e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301d5c6-b7f6-4b94-9a10-e64fd74ef3a9)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

It's far easier to review these commits one at a time._\r\n\r\n- Fix DPI scaling problems with `FormGitIgnore` buttons\r\n- There were ignore patterns for `.vs` and `_ReSharper` but not for `.idea` which is added by Rider so I've added that\r\n\t- Example text was not reflecting the default patterns used, at least to me it seems these should match\r\n\t- The change I am not too sure of is I've gone through all the translation files and updates these patterns by hand meticulously checking to not break anything \ud83d\ude05\r\n- I've increased the default height of the form\r\n- Enabled the vertical scrollbar for the `Examples` section as it doesn't fit by default\r\n- I've noticed at random a comment by @mstv asking for a mnemonic so added that too :) https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/11661#pullrequestreview-2012080628\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n100%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/85cc81ae-0b9c-4430-84da-5c98de4ebc77)\r\n\r\n200% \ud83d\ude22\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/6d6431a5-d12e-45ec-893d-a3d762c9f55e)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n200%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/59a3f003-1719-4228-9089-975282978ea2)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Manually at 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- Windows 11\r\n- 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

There could be a key just cycling instead.\r\nIn the way I use it, I normally want a way to get back to the normal \"patch\" view.\r\n\r\nIcons are from Fugue and Diffstatic favicon. (viewed in 175%)\r\n\r\n--\r\nTo learn more about Difftastic, see: https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/tree/master\r\nSome documentation will need to be written for this.\r\n\r\nTo use this functionality, you need to install difftastic, just drop the binary somewhere.\r\nDefine a difftool named \"difftastic\", e.g. adding to ~/.gitconfig\r\n\r\nWindows example:\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]                                           \r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWSL\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]\r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Other external difftools could potentially be tried out in a similar way, if they are called *difftastic*, they will be displayed. The printout may not be parsed correctly, line numbers may not be displayed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThen is it useful?\r\n\r\nSee the doc of what the structural diff gives. It is an alternative view to toggle when viewing patches, just like git-word-diff.\r\nI have set single key hotkeys to quickly toggle when reviewing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe intention was first just to displaythe raw output, but it grow to integrate Difftastic as well as possible. It is not intended as a native view.\r\n\r\n* Difftastic is not intended to be parsed, some situations are guesses. Worst case is though that the line numbers are not shown or displayed twice. It would be better if the output was parsable, could be changed in difftastic. The divider for side-by-side is occasionally green: ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/ae2264bf-ad74-48db-95d2-8e30126c155f)\r\n* Header is the same as in the CLI: The Git temp file name\r\n* Column size for side-by-side is guessed, cannot be adjusted\r\n* When copying information, you copy the text as you see, also for side-by-side. I guess it\r\n* GE theme colors (reverse video highlighting) is guessed from use of red, bold-red, green, bold-green which is not always correct. There is a PR for better display, see https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/pull/690#issuecomment-2030799275. Theming in Difftastic is maybe a later step.\r\n* difftastic is considerably slower than git-diff and the output is not cached. Caching would require adding the environment variables configuring difftastic to be included (as column size is set when calling the command\r\n* It would be nice to have staging of lines in the viewer.

        "Add new `TargetPlatform` property, to control the specific platform for the GE installer (.msi) package.\r\n\r\nCurrently the GE installer package is hard-coded to be built for the `x86` platform, with `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the default installation folder.  This makes sense to install it on the `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform, but a bit weird on `x64` (i.e. 64-bit) Windows platform (as discussed in #11554), and really feels weird when building an `Arm64-specific` installer package for Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nThis commit defines a new `TargetPlatform` property which can take the following values: `x64` (default), `x86`, or `arm64` (must be lower-case values, as required by Wix). This property is passed on to the `Platform` parameter for WiX to create relevant installer package specific to that platform. Like any other property, this `TargetPlatform` property can be specified on the command line to build a platform-specific installer, rather than using the default `x64` platform value.\r\n\r\nTo build GE, the current build command series still work as before:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj\r\ndotnet publish -c Release\r\n```\r\nand the following build artifacts are produced in the `artifacts\\Release\\publish` folder for the `x64` platform; for example:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform. It can be installed on Windows on Arm64 platform, as this platform contains translation layer for running `x64` program.\r\n\r\nIf the `TargetPlatform=x86` property value is specified in the `publish` command, like:\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=x86\r\n```\r\nthen the following files are produced:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x86` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the installation folder, and can install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows, `x64` Windows and Windows on Arm64 platforms.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to produce an `Arm64-specific` installer package, the following build commands should be executed on a Windows on Arm64 box:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\n```\r\nand the following files will be produced for Arm64:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `arm64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on any Windows platform except the Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nFixes #9990\r\nFixes #11554\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n- default build GE installer for `x64` platform, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform (but none are available to test.)\r\n- build of `x86` platform GE installer, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=x86` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files (x86)` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should work on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n- build GE installer for `Arm64` platform, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=arm64` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on Arm64 Windows platform.

It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s)\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 & 11 on x64 platform\r\n- Windows 11 on Arm64 platform\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Fixes #11464\r\nFixes #11517\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTBD, opened to get feedback.\r\nDescription will be improved too, as well as screenshots.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFileViewer: Restructure HighlightService\r\n\r\nMove handling of \"normal\" patches from the shared\r\nDiffHighlightService to PatchHighlightService.\r\n\r\nVarious code cleanups.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a preparation for Git coloring and git-grep.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit diff coloring\r\n\r\nUse the coloring by git-diff instead of GE internal algorithm,\r\nby using Git ANSI terminal escape sequences.\r\nThis enables for instance view moved code.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Git coloring is set by default, the existing engine is still available.\r\nThe GE theme colors for added/removed code (reverse green/red) is applied by default (default Git to just set foreground text is can be configured).\r\nGit by default warns about white space, this is disabled by default (diff.colorMovedWS).\r\nA user can override the Git colors for each \"slot\" (see below), but this is not available in GE UI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit word diff coloring\r\n\r\nEnable Git word diff coloring view.\r\nThis is an alternative view for diff, not in patch format.\r\nThe differences are coded on the same line.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: \"GE word highlighting\" is the default, \"Git diff highlighting\" can be enabled.\r\nBy default Git highlights changed words. If the user has not set diff.wordRegex, change by character is used ('.').\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat is not in this PR:\r\n- Documentation for the changes, how colors etc can be changed by Git config\r\n- Tests are added for the \"decoding escape sequence handling\". The status for other parts is the same as before (there are no major benefits for adding tests)\r\n- Tuned colors fully matching theming\r\n- A more generic way to display diff in other ways, like using diff-so-fancy or delta. That is probably a different view, similar to Blame in diff (but using the same FileViewer).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nTBD, see #11464 for now\r\n\r\n### moved\r\n\r\nThe third is \"Git default\", no GE theme override, whitespace errors\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/7f714ef3-9978-43c7-a2c8-899ca18509f3) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/93e0afac-5543-43dd-9a15-056eb6624a1f) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/1df174ee-c9c6-47e5-898c-805c076503ea)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/d5a19320-d69b-44a3-b244-c2047233a81d) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/3f06316f-41d7-428e-b4d6-0d7b4ff4af6b) \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/0bd536ca-40c0-4cb0-adb8-cdd1326e9759) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/56571c0c-e47b-4840-87d5-396b8bdbf020)\r\n\r\n### range diff - the GE coloring is very limited\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/5a8dae94-99b4-4c2b-beba-a7ced1ef053c) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/6866e09a-ff40-459e-8006-ac34d4416880)\r\n\r\nA missed merge (color should have been yellow, I have modified it).

A terminal uses a \"theme\" to translate these colors.\r\nThe \"theme\" for these colors in this PR is displayed below as well as the GE theme colors overriding the default.

This solution has has not worked since GE v4, that use .NET core (.net6 and later). .net9 has experimental support for dark mode that can enable the use of dark mode.\r\n\r\nThe activation of hooking was disabled by the define SUPPORT_THEME_HOOKS. A number of unused methods was used too,\r\nas well as the EasyHooks submodule.\r\n\r\nThe .net9 solution do not allow customization of system colors, so overrides were removed from the themes.\r\nAs the darksilver theme mostly changed system colors, it was removed.\r\n\r\nThe invariant theme system colors is required by theming to adjust colors and still requires the system colors.\r\nThe color for MenuHighlight was corrected in the invaiant theme. ButtonFace, ButtonHighlight, ButtonShadow was assumed to be duplicates of Control* colors, this was not corrrect and the handling was removed.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for dark header was removed too.\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nVisual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

This solution has has not worked since GE v4, that use .NET core (.net6 and later). .net9 has experimental support for dark mode that can enable the use of dark mode.\r\n\r\nThe activation of hooking was disabled by the define SUPPORT_THEME_HOOKS. A number of unused methods was used too,\r\nas well as the EasyHooks submodule.\r\n\r\nThe .net9 solution do not allow customization of system colors, so overrides were removed from the themes.\r\nAs the darksilver theme mostly changed system colors, it was removed.\r\n\r\nThe invariant theme system colors is required by theming to adjust colors and still requires the system colors.\r\nThe color for MenuHighlight was corrected in the invaiant theme. ButtonFace, ButtonHighlight, ButtonShadow was assumed to be duplicates of Control* colors, this was not corrrect and the handling was removed.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for dark header was removed too.\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nVisual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

GE may calculate the color to be white, this is a an override to avoid the low contrast without risking breaking other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/11843#issue-2473084897\r\neven if that issue is about something related.\r\nI cannot reproduce, this is a good enough default configuration as theming is limited anyway.\r\n(and colors can be overridden with git-config)\r\n\r\nNote that colors set as \"black brightyellow\" instead of \"black yellow bold\" as that has a separate meaning - a separate PR will clarify.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\nwhite foreground is configured in debugger, cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f137997-fb5d-4b52-b925-832c1df12aa0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7303c7a-8b34-4cdb-af32-e349d0afd3ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd004c3e-6f4f-4f7e-a49e-7749801c8370)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44acb6-eba6-4835-a338-9ec1bfa87255)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31223b74-4458-4bcd-b11a-5b6c0c88a92e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301d5c6-b7f6-4b94-9a10-e64fd74ef3a9)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

GE may calculate the color to be white, this is a an override to avoid the low contrast without risking breaking other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/11843#issue-2473084897\r\neven if that issue is about something related.\r\nI cannot reproduce, this is a good enough default configuration as theming is limited anyway.\r\n(and colors can be overridden with git-config)\r\n\r\nNote that colors set as \"black brightyellow\" instead of \"black yellow bold\" as that has a separate meaning - a separate PR will clarify.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\nwhite foreground is configured in debugger, cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f137997-fb5d-4b52-b925-832c1df12aa0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7303c7a-8b34-4cdb-af32-e349d0afd3ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd004c3e-6f4f-4f7e-a49e-7749801c8370)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44acb6-eba6-4835-a338-9ec1bfa87255)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31223b74-4458-4bcd-b11a-5b6c0c88a92e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301d5c6-b7f6-4b94-9a10-e64fd74ef3a9)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

It's far easier to review these commits one at a time._\r\n\r\n- Fix DPI scaling problems with `FormGitIgnore` buttons\r\n- There were ignore patterns for `.vs` and `_ReSharper` but not for `.idea` which is added by Rider so I've added that\r\n\t- Example text was not reflecting the default patterns used, at least to me it seems these should match\r\n\t- The change I am not too sure of is I've gone through all the translation files and updates these patterns by hand meticulously checking to not break anything \ud83d\ude05\r\n- I've increased the default height of the form\r\n- Enabled the vertical scrollbar for the `Examples` section as it doesn't fit by default\r\n- I've noticed at random a comment by @mstv asking for a mnemonic so added that too :) https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/11661#pullrequestreview-2012080628\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n100%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/85cc81ae-0b9c-4430-84da-5c98de4ebc77)\r\n\r\n200% \ud83d\ude22\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/6d6431a5-d12e-45ec-893d-a3d762c9f55e)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n200%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/59a3f003-1719-4228-9089-975282978ea2)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Manually at 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- Windows 11\r\n- 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

There could be a key just cycling instead.\r\nIn the way I use it, I normally want a way to get back to the normal \"patch\" view.\r\n\r\nIcons are from Fugue and Diffstatic favicon. (viewed in 175%)\r\n\r\n--\r\nTo learn more about Difftastic, see: https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/tree/master\r\nSome documentation will need to be written for this.\r\n\r\nTo use this functionality, you need to install difftastic, just drop the binary somewhere.\r\nDefine a difftool named \"difftastic\", e.g. adding to ~/.gitconfig\r\n\r\nWindows example:\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]                                           \r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWSL\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]\r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Other external difftools could potentially be tried out in a similar way, if they are called *difftastic*, they will be displayed. The printout may not be parsed correctly, line numbers may not be displayed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThen is it useful?\r\n\r\nSee the doc of what the structural diff gives. It is an alternative view to toggle when viewing patches, just like git-word-diff.\r\nI have set single key hotkeys to quickly toggle when reviewing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe intention was first just to displaythe raw output, but it grow to integrate Difftastic as well as possible. It is not intended as a native view.\r\n\r\n* Difftastic is not intended to be parsed, some situations are guesses. Worst case is though that the line numbers are not shown or displayed twice. It would be better if the output was parsable, could be changed in difftastic. The divider for side-by-side is occasionally green: ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/ae2264bf-ad74-48db-95d2-8e30126c155f)\r\n* Header is the same as in the CLI: The Git temp file name\r\n* Column size for side-by-side is guessed, cannot be adjusted\r\n* When copying information, you copy the text as you see, also for side-by-side. I guess it\r\n* GE theme colors (reverse video highlighting) is guessed from use of red, bold-red, green, bold-green which is not always correct. There is a PR for better display, see https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/pull/690#issuecomment-2030799275. Theming in Difftastic is maybe a later step.\r\n* difftastic is considerably slower than git-diff and the output is not cached. Caching would require adding the environment variables configuring difftastic to be included (as column size is set when calling the command\r\n* It would be nice to have staging of lines in the viewer.

        "Add new `TargetPlatform` property, to control the specific platform for the GE installer (.msi) package.\r\n\r\nCurrently the GE installer package is hard-coded to be built for the `x86` platform, with `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the default installation folder.  This makes sense to install it on the `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform, but a bit weird on `x64` (i.e. 64-bit) Windows platform (as discussed in #11554), and really feels weird when building an `Arm64-specific` installer package for Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nThis commit defines a new `TargetPlatform` property which can take the following values: `x64` (default), `x86`, or `arm64` (must be lower-case values, as required by Wix). This property is passed on to the `Platform` parameter for WiX to create relevant installer package specific to that platform. Like any other property, this `TargetPlatform` property can be specified on the command line to build a platform-specific installer, rather than using the default `x64` platform value.\r\n\r\nTo build GE, the current build command series still work as before:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj\r\ndotnet publish -c Release\r\n```\r\nand the following build artifacts are produced in the `artifacts\\Release\\publish` folder for the `x64` platform; for example:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform. It can be installed on Windows on Arm64 platform, as this platform contains translation layer for running `x64` program.\r\n\r\nIf the `TargetPlatform=x86` property value is specified in the `publish` command, like:\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=x86\r\n```\r\nthen the following files are produced:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x86` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the installation folder, and can install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows, `x64` Windows and Windows on Arm64 platforms.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to produce an `Arm64-specific` installer package, the following build commands should be executed on a Windows on Arm64 box:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\n```\r\nand the following files will be produced for Arm64:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `arm64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on any Windows platform except the Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nFixes #9990\r\nFixes #11554\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n- default build GE installer for `x64` platform, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform (but none are available to test.)\r\n- build of `x86` platform GE installer, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=x86` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files (x86)` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should work on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n- build GE installer for `Arm64` platform, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=arm64` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on Arm64 Windows platform.

It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s)\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 & 11 on x64 platform\r\n- Windows 11 on Arm64 platform\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Fixes #11464\r\nFixes #11517\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTBD, opened to get feedback.\r\nDescription will be improved too, as well as screenshots.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFileViewer: Restructure HighlightService\r\n\r\nMove handling of \"normal\" patches from the shared\r\nDiffHighlightService to PatchHighlightService.\r\n\r\nVarious code cleanups.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a preparation for Git coloring and git-grep.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit diff coloring\r\n\r\nUse the coloring by git-diff instead of GE internal algorithm,\r\nby using Git ANSI terminal escape sequences.\r\nThis enables for instance view moved code.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Git coloring is set by default, the existing engine is still available.\r\nThe GE theme colors for added/removed code (reverse green/red) is applied by default (default Git to just set foreground text is can be configured).\r\nGit by default warns about white space, this is disabled by default (diff.colorMovedWS).\r\nA user can override the Git colors for each \"slot\" (see below), but this is not available in GE UI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit word diff coloring\r\n\r\nEnable Git word diff coloring view.\r\nThis is an alternative view for diff, not in patch format.\r\nThe differences are coded on the same line.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: \"GE word highlighting\" is the default, \"Git diff highlighting\" can be enabled.\r\nBy default Git highlights changed words. If the user has not set diff.wordRegex, change by character is used ('.').\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat is not in this PR:\r\n- Documentation for the changes, how colors etc can be changed by Git config\r\n- Tests are added for the \"decoding escape sequence handling\". The status for other parts is the same as before (there are no major benefits for adding tests)\r\n- Tuned colors fully matching theming\r\n- A more generic way to display diff in other ways, like using diff-so-fancy or delta. That is probably a different view, similar to Blame in diff (but using the same FileViewer).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nTBD, see #11464 for now\r\n\r\n### moved\r\n\r\nThe third is \"Git default\", no GE theme override, whitespace errors\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/7f714ef3-9978-43c7-a2c8-899ca18509f3) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/93e0afac-5543-43dd-9a15-056eb6624a1f) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/1df174ee-c9c6-47e5-898c-805c076503ea)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/d5a19320-d69b-44a3-b244-c2047233a81d) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/3f06316f-41d7-428e-b4d6-0d7b4ff4af6b) \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/0bd536ca-40c0-4cb0-adb8-cdd1326e9759) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/56571c0c-e47b-4840-87d5-396b8bdbf020)\r\n\r\n### range diff - the GE coloring is very limited\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/5a8dae94-99b4-4c2b-beba-a7ced1ef053c) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/6866e09a-ff40-459e-8006-ac34d4416880)\r\n\r\nA missed merge (color should have been yellow, I have modified it).

A terminal uses a \"theme\" to translate these colors.\r\nThe \"theme\" for these colors in this PR is displayed below as well as the GE theme colors overriding the default.

This solution has has not worked since GE v4, that use .NET core (.net6 and later). .net9 has experimental support for dark mode that can enable the use of dark mode.\r\n\r\nThe activation of hooking was disabled by the define SUPPORT_THEME_HOOKS. A number of unused methods was used too,\r\nas well as the EasyHooks submodule.\r\n\r\nThe .net9 solution do not allow customization of system colors, so overrides were removed from the themes.\r\nAs the darksilver theme mostly changed system colors, it was removed.\r\n\r\nThe invariant theme system colors is required by theming to adjust colors and still requires the system colors.\r\nThe color for MenuHighlight was corrected in the invaiant theme. ButtonFace, ButtonHighlight, ButtonShadow was assumed to be duplicates of Control* colors, this was not corrrect and the handling was removed.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for dark header was removed too.\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nVisual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

GE may calculate the color to be white, this is a an override to avoid the low contrast without risking breaking other scenarios.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen in https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/issues/11843#issue-2473084897\r\neven if that issue is about something related.\r\nI cannot reproduce, this is a good enough default configuration as theming is limited anyway.\r\n(and colors can be overridden with git-config)\r\n\r\nNote that colors set as \"black brightyellow\" instead of \"black yellow bold\" as that has a separate meaning - a separate PR will clarify.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\nwhite foreground is configured in debugger, cannot reproduce.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f137997-fb5d-4b52-b925-832c1df12aa0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7303c7a-8b34-4cdb-af32-e349d0afd3ed)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd004c3e-6f4f-4f7e-a49e-7749801c8370)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c44acb6-eba6-4835-a338-9ec1bfa87255)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31223b74-4458-4bcd-b11a-5b6c0c88a92e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1301d5c6-b7f6-4b94-9a10-e64fd74ef3a9)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nmanual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

It's far easier to review these commits one at a time._\r\n\r\n- Fix DPI scaling problems with `FormGitIgnore` buttons\r\n- There were ignore patterns for `.vs` and `_ReSharper` but not for `.idea` which is added by Rider so I've added that\r\n\t- Example text was not reflecting the default patterns used, at least to me it seems these should match\r\n\t- The change I am not too sure of is I've gone through all the translation files and updates these patterns by hand meticulously checking to not break anything \ud83d\ude05\r\n- I've increased the default height of the form\r\n- Enabled the vertical scrollbar for the `Examples` section as it doesn't fit by default\r\n- I've noticed at random a comment by @mstv asking for a mnemonic so added that too :) https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/pull/11661#pullrequestreview-2012080628\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n100%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/85cc81ae-0b9c-4430-84da-5c98de4ebc77)\r\n\r\n200% \ud83d\ude22\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/6d6431a5-d12e-45ec-893d-a3d762c9f55e)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n200%\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/483659/59a3f003-1719-4228-9089-975282978ea2)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Manually at 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- Windows 11\r\n- 100% and 200% scaling\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

There could be a key just cycling instead.\r\nIn the way I use it, I normally want a way to get back to the normal \"patch\" view.\r\n\r\nIcons are from Fugue and Diffstatic favicon. (viewed in 175%)\r\n\r\n--\r\nTo learn more about Difftastic, see: https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/tree/master\r\nSome documentation will need to be written for this.\r\n\r\nTo use this functionality, you need to install difftastic, just drop the binary somewhere.\r\nDefine a difftool named \"difftastic\", e.g. adding to ~/.gitconfig\r\n\r\nWindows example:\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]                                           \r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWSL\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]\r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Other external difftools could potentially be tried out in a similar way, if they are called *difftastic*, they will be displayed. The printout may not be parsed correctly, line numbers may not be displayed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThen is it useful?\r\n\r\nSee the doc of what the structural diff gives. It is an alternative view to toggle when viewing patches, just like git-word-diff.\r\nI have set single key hotkeys to quickly toggle when reviewing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe intention was first just to displaythe raw output, but it grow to integrate Difftastic as well as possible. It is not intended as a native view.\r\n\r\n* Difftastic is not intended to be parsed, some situations are guesses. Worst case is though that the line numbers are not shown or displayed twice. It would be better if the output was parsable, could be changed in difftastic. The divider for side-by-side is occasionally green: ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/ae2264bf-ad74-48db-95d2-8e30126c155f)\r\n* Header is the same as in the CLI: The Git temp file name\r\n* Column size for side-by-side is guessed, cannot be adjusted\r\n* When copying information, you copy the text as you see, also for side-by-side. I guess it\r\n* GE theme colors (reverse video highlighting) is guessed from use of red, bold-red, green, bold-green which is not always correct. There is a PR for better display, see https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/pull/690#issuecomment-2030799275. Theming in Difftastic is maybe a later step.\r\n* difftastic is considerably slower than git-diff and the output is not cached. Caching would require adding the environment variables configuring difftastic to be included (as column size is set when calling the command\r\n* It would be nice to have staging of lines in the viewer.

        "Add new `TargetPlatform` property, to control the specific platform for the GE installer (.msi) package.\r\n\r\nCurrently the GE installer package is hard-coded to be built for the `x86` platform, with `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the default installation folder.  This makes sense to install it on the `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform, but a bit weird on `x64` (i.e. 64-bit) Windows platform (as discussed in #11554), and really feels weird when building an `Arm64-specific` installer package for Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nThis commit defines a new `TargetPlatform` property which can take the following values: `x64` (default), `x86`, or `arm64` (must be lower-case values, as required by Wix). This property is passed on to the `Platform` parameter for WiX to create relevant installer package specific to that platform. Like any other property, this `TargetPlatform` property can be specified on the command line to build a platform-specific installer, rather than using the default `x64` platform value.\r\n\r\nTo build GE, the current build command series still work as before:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj\r\ndotnet publish -c Release\r\n```\r\nand the following build artifacts are produced in the `artifacts\\Release\\publish` folder for the `x64` platform; for example:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform. It can be installed on Windows on Arm64 platform, as this platform contains translation layer for running `x64` program.\r\n\r\nIf the `TargetPlatform=x86` property value is specified in the `publish` command, like:\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=x86\r\n```\r\nthen the following files are produced:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x86` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the installation folder, and can install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows, `x64` Windows and Windows on Arm64 platforms.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to produce an `Arm64-specific` installer package, the following build commands should be executed on a Windows on Arm64 box:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\n```\r\nand the following files will be produced for Arm64:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `arm64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on any Windows platform except the Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nFixes #9990\r\nFixes #11554\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n- default build GE installer for `x64` platform, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform (but none are available to test.)\r\n- build of `x86` platform GE installer, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=x86` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files (x86)` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should work on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n- build GE installer for `Arm64` platform, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=arm64` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on Arm64 Windows platform.

It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s)\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 & 11 on x64 platform\r\n- Windows 11 on Arm64 platform\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "Fixes #11464\r\nFixes #11517\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nTBD, opened to get feedback.\r\nDescription will be improved too, as well as screenshots.\r\n\r\n--\r\nFileViewer: Restructure HighlightService\r\n\r\nMove handling of \"normal\" patches from the shared\r\nDiffHighlightService to PatchHighlightService.\r\n\r\nVarious code cleanups.\r\n\r\nThis commit is a preparation for Git coloring and git-grep.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit diff coloring\r\n\r\nUse the coloring by git-diff instead of GE internal algorithm,\r\nby using Git ANSI terminal escape sequences.\r\nThis enables for instance view moved code.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: Git coloring is set by default, the existing engine is still available.\r\nThe GE theme colors for added/removed code (reverse green/red) is applied by default (default Git to just set foreground text is can be configured).\r\nGit by default warns about white space, this is disabled by default (diff.colorMovedWS).\r\nA user can override the Git colors for each \"slot\" (see below), but this is not available in GE UI.\r\n\r\n--\r\nGit word diff coloring\r\n\r\nEnable Git word diff coloring view.\r\nThis is an alternative view for diff, not in patch format.\r\nThe differences are coded on the same line.\r\n\r\nConfiguration: \"GE word highlighting\" is the default, \"Git diff highlighting\" can be enabled.\r\nBy default Git highlights changed words. If the user has not set diff.wordRegex, change by character is used ('.').\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nWhat is not in this PR:\r\n- Documentation for the changes, how colors etc can be changed by Git config\r\n- Tests are added for the \"decoding escape sequence handling\". The status for other parts is the same as before (there are no major benefits for adding tests)\r\n- Tuned colors fully matching theming\r\n- A more generic way to display diff in other ways, like using diff-so-fancy or delta. That is probably a different view, similar to Blame in diff (but using the same FileViewer).\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nTBD, see #11464 for now\r\n\r\n### moved\r\n\r\nThe third is \"Git default\", no GE theme override, whitespace errors\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/7f714ef3-9978-43c7-a2c8-899ca18509f3) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/93e0afac-5543-43dd-9a15-056eb6624a1f) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/1df174ee-c9c6-47e5-898c-805c076503ea)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/d5a19320-d69b-44a3-b244-c2047233a81d) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/3f06316f-41d7-428e-b4d6-0d7b4ff4af6b) \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/0bd536ca-40c0-4cb0-adb8-cdd1326e9759) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/56571c0c-e47b-4840-87d5-396b8bdbf020)\r\n\r\n### range diff - the GE coloring is very limited\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/5a8dae94-99b4-4c2b-beba-a7ced1ef053c) ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/6866e09a-ff40-459e-8006-ac34d4416880)\r\n\r\nA missed merge (color should have been yellow, I have modified it).

A terminal uses a \"theme\" to translate these colors.\r\nThe \"theme\" for these colors in this PR is displayed below as well as the GE theme colors overriding the default.

My notes are usually short and often re-generated by scripts.\r\n\r\nThe only initially visible change is a new menu item: View / Show git notes column.\r\nChecking it adds a new column to the revision grid, between \"Message\" and \"Avatar\".\r\nThis column displays the first row of a note.\r\nNotes displayed by CommitDataBodyRenderer (Commit tab of the \"Commit info\" pane) and MessageColumnProvider remain unaffected.\r\n\r\nChecking either one of the \"Show notes...\" menu items enables note loading. Checking only the old menu item \"Show notes\" also shows notes ref.  Checking only the \"Show notes column\" item leads to displaynig notes text in columns and commit info, but hiding notes \"ref\".\r\n\r\nI`ve simplified the code a bit, now the CommitData and GitRevision classes have separate members for \"Body\" and \"Notes\". Parsing/re-formatting logic has been adjusted accordingly, code duplicates were not fixed in order to minimise footprint.\r\nThis change probably also fixes some potential bugs, as the notes are no longer part of the content of the message body internally.\r\n\r\n~Fixes #11413 \r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- \r\n- \r\n- \r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\nOriginally without the column (menu item un-checked). \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/64522720/eb0c06b6-4d98-4590-b029-36b4f760322c)\r\n\r\n### After\r\nFeature turned on, notes not displayed in MessageColumn, but in the separate one.\r\nEither case, the notes are displayed in the \"commit info\" html pane, there`s plenty of space there.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/64522720/0e83984f-4121-4dda-acd2-faca4eb5bd5e)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- \r\n- \r\n- \r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT <!-- Add version 2.11 or above -->\r\n- Windows <!-- Add version 7 SP1 or above -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

(When working with this I have often used it to view worktree too.)\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep\r\n\r\nThe UI in this PR adds a popup as well as a searchbox to the Diff tab.\r\n\r\nThe searchbox dropdown has the search history for the GE session, not persistent.\r\nThe popup and searchbox are kept in sync.\r\n\r\nSearch in the popup is done when button is pressed (or Enter),\r\nthe diff tab box is searching when typing (similar in the filter).\r\nIf there is no `-e ` in the search string, this is added to the search string.\r\nMost git-grep options can be added, including  `--and` etc.\r\n\r\ngit-grep options to handle case insensitive is available, but most options can be added in the searchbox.\r\nPersistent options can be added too for instance `--show-function`.\r\n\r\nThe output of git-grep is always for a commit, including index and worktree.\r\nNote that the selected file in the grep group is not always followed when a new commit is selected, as it is not the primary group. This could be specially handled (but \"grep\" knowledge need to be added to RevDiff).\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\nIn the Git repo, the git-grep requires about 200 ms for me, the information is added async after normal diff so no visible.\r\nFor the Linux repo, git-grep can require several seconds. As the current search is aborted when a new is started, works fine for me.\r\nThe processing in the fileviewer is faster than for normal diffs.\r\n\r\nLimitations are basically the same as #11590 ,missing\r\n* Documentation for the changes, how colors etc can be changed by Git config\r\n* tests for the new functionality.

        "Depends on #12064 #12116 #12152 and more\r\nOtherwise I consider this to be very usable, just waiting dor the dependencies\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR for theming with https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857\r\nThis is not as good looking as what @NikolayXHD did for GE 3.x, but it follows the standard Windows dark mode.\r\nThere are many limitations and issues in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/pull/11857 still, it\r\nis a later call to use this now or not.\r\nThe standard theme is not modified by this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR has a number of tweaks to the setup to make this mostly usable, there are a number of issues still.\r\nThis is a preliminary summary of the status, to be added close to screenshots later.\r\n\r\nThis adds both a \"dark\" theme with mostly system colors that is quite gray and a \"dark+\" that is slightly darker.\r\n\r\nStill to do - many the same in ge 3 dark mode\r\n\r\n* Some adapted colors like Reset is a little muted, add specific colors? Cleanup the adaption in general?\r\n* Add some kind of disclaimer for dark mode - at least that it is experimental in .net9. Win10 (and Win11 23H2?) is not expected to fully work too\r\n* Some issues seen below may be improved\r\n* tooltips and various other like disabled text boxes are bright, no dramatic issue [(also reported)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11954)\r\n* Forms extending from GitExtensionsForm are much darker than the \"modern\" forms based on GitExtensionsDialog. This applies to for instance Settings and FindInFile, total of 20 forms. There is a difference for the light theme too, but the difference is bigger for dark mode. Certainly not in this PR.\r\n* Syntax highlighting in the editor looks bad. The colors are adapted from the hardcoded highlighting per file type, there is no way to set specific colors (or use system colors?).\r\n\r\nFor .NET10\r\n\r\n* ListView group headers like for remotes and in the dashboard is unreadable. FileStatusList is changed in #12116. Tracked in https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953  This will not be changed in this PR, await .NET10\r\nThe ListView unreadable text is very annoying but I believe the text is in such forms that this can be accepted.\r\nThere will need to more color tweaking.\r\n\r\nContrast is generally quite low though, most of this in the WinForms colors. The dark+ theme has slightly better contrast, more like ge3 dark.\r\nSome overrides were already implemented, like for https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues/11953\r\n\r\nMostly run on Win11, a few visuals on Win10\r\n\r\nThe darksilver theme was removed, it would be the same as the dark theme as system colors cannot be changed.\r\nSimilar highcontrast_dark was removed, not needed.\r\nInvariant theme system colors are hardcoded, required to adjust colors.\r\n\r\nI will appreciate if someone that is better in design and override .NET painting (.NET and GUI is not my strength, this is a hobby!) joins.\r\n\r\nSome of the commits in this PR may be separated to individual PRs.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\nNot updated with the latest changes\r\n\r\nShould this show GE 3.x/5.1/DarkMode?\r\n\r\nFor now some visual style examples and issues\r\n\r\nGeneral look, with #12152 and #12116 etc\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f57634-757e-4e40-bd1e-fc7151c585b0)\r\n\r\nBefore #12152 and #12116 etc, see the unreadable FileStatusList group text\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bec1722-7c21-4955-9788-f2f4b4285c7c)\r\n\r\nAnsi colors in dark, mostly readable\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0e5df8d-8a43-4249-95eb-32383550d70d)\r\ndark+\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db7daf53-ede3-459d-a23d-34390fe2274d)\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of Flat style (as in the PR) vs Standard.\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e965c06-56bb-458b-a546-369c1c028a57) \r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9394deee-f47a-4f1b-ae79-03741f1dbaf5)\r\n\r\nExample of light tooltip\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa63f3ba-6891-474d-b02e-503fcc4c3c55)\r\n\r\nA few usages of ListView that is not FileStatusList use ListView header\r\nKeep as this until .net10\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23f7bbb5-f785-4fb9-9c7f-f906afe59360)\r\n\r\nDisabled button text is hard to read\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7923bb44-43e5-44e3-90a6-cf96a6048325)\r\n\r\nPanels in dark+ are darker, but tab foreground is still SystemColors.Windows (and inactive tabs is not so far from the background).

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n`DllImport` causes binding code to be generated at run time, which can hurt startup performance. It also precludes use of NativeAOT compilation.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the newer `LibraryImport` (.NET 7) which performs the binding at compile time via a source generator.\r\n\r\nThis fixes instances of diagnostic SYSLIB1054.\r\n\r\nThe changes here were made by a code fix, with a few exceptions:\r\n\r\n- I had to roll a few automated changes back as they wouldn't compile.\r\n- I had to explicitly specify string marshaling as UTF-16 in one instance.\r\n- I had to rename a function from `SendMessage` to `SendMessageW` to avoid an exception when opening `FormCommit`.\r\n\r\nAs this last point suggests, this still uses late binding. It's just the code generation that's done up front.\r\n\r\nThere are also possible changes in `conemu` and `ICSharpCode.TextEditor`, but they would have to be filed separately.\r\n\r\nMore info on this at:\r\n\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation\r\n- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/syslib-diagnostics/syslib1050-1069\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual testing. It's possible that these changes fail at run time (as mentioned above) and most P/Invoke happens in the UI, so only using the UI will draw issues out. I'd avoid merging this right before a public release, just to give time for developers in the repo to hit any issues here. That said, I ran through a bunch of UI scenarios and didn't hit any problems.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT N/A\r\n- Windows 11\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI don't mind.

        "\u2026 to improved group parsing in URLs\r\n\r\nThis commit addresses an issue where the BuildServerIntegration with GitLab was failing to correctly obtain ProjectIds.\r\n\r\nAn inconsistency was encountered in parsing GitLab project URLs, particularly those with nested namespaces (e.g., `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`). Previously, the namespace was incorrectly parsed as `xdtest`, and the host was mistakenly inclusive of the first part of the namespace (`git.xxx.ai/aot`), leading to failed Project ID retrievals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFixes \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nGiven a project URL `https://git.xxx.ai/aot/xdtest/agv.git`:\r\n- Incorrect Namespace Parsing: `xdtest`\r\n- Incorrect Host Interpretation: `git.xxx.ai/aot`\r\n\r\naot/xdtest/agv.git == [groupName]/[groupName]/[Project name].git\r\n\r\n**Reproduction Steps:**\r\n\r\n1. Configure the BuildServerIntegration with a GitLab instance containing projects\r\n2.  Instance https://git.xxx.ai\r\n3. Click on the \"Get Project ID from server\" button.\r\n4. Observe that the system fails to retrieve the correct Project ID due to namespace parsing errors.",

        "Implements #11618 \r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nSupport Difftastic as an alternative difftool output in addition to the standard \"patch\" and recently added \"git-word-diff\" views.\r\n\r\nThe Difftastic output is mostly presented as-is without changes (except that there is an attempt to apply Git theme colors).\r\nThe info is parsed to show file line info and allow navigation.\r\n\r\nThe current \"Git word diff\" toggle is changed to a dropdown.\r\n\r\nThe hotkeys toggle on/off, back to patch if set. There could be a key just cycling instead.\r\nIn the way I use it, I normally want a way to get back to the normal \"patch\" view.\r\n\r\nIcons are from Fugue and Diffstatic favicon. (viewed in 175%)\r\n\r\n--\r\nTo learn more about Difftastic, see: https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/tree/master\r\nSome documentation will need to be written for this.\r\n\r\nTo use this functionality, you need to install difftastic, just drop the binary somewhere.\r\nDefine a difftool named \"difftastic\", e.g. adding to ~/.gitconfig\r\n\r\nWindows example:\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]                                           \r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWSL\r\n```\r\n[difftool \"difftastic\"]\r\n        cmd = /c/cygwin/home/user/bin/difft.exe \"$LOCAL\" \"$REMOTE\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Other external difftools could potentially be tried out in a similar way, if they are called *difftastic*, they will be displayed. The printout may not be parsed correctly, line numbers may not be displayed.\r\n\r\n--\r\nThen is it useful?\r\n\r\nSee the doc of what the structural diff gives. It is an alternative view to toggle when viewing patches, just like git-word-diff.\r\nI have set single key hotkeys to quickly toggle when reviewing.\r\n\r\n--\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe intention was first just to displaythe raw output, but it grow to integrate Difftastic as well as possible. It is not intended as a native view.\r\n\r\n* Difftastic is not intended to be parsed, some situations are guesses. Worst case is though that the line numbers are not shown or displayed twice. It would be better if the output was parsable, could be changed in difftastic. The divider for side-by-side is occasionally green: ![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/ae2264bf-ad74-48db-95d2-8e30126c155f)\r\n* Header is the same as in the CLI: The Git temp file name\r\n* Column size for side-by-side is guessed, cannot be adjusted\r\n* When copying information, you copy the text as you see, also for side-by-side. I guess it\r\n* GE theme colors (reverse video highlighting) is guessed from use of red, bold-red, green, bold-green which is not always correct. There is a PR for better display, see https://github.com/Wilfred/difftastic/pull/690#issuecomment-2030799275. Theming in Difftastic is maybe a later step.\r\n* difftastic is considerably slower than git-diff and the output is not cached. Caching would require adding the environment variables configuring difftastic to be included (as column size is set when calling the command\r\n* It would be nice to have staging of lines in the viewer. This requires access to a real patch so it is not trivial.\r\n* Some file formats like CMake are not handled well, I prefer to force viewing them as text...\r\n* Ignore whitespace would be a nice addition to difftastic, even if spaces are not adding to structural differences\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/b73e9e87-7bbe-47ba-b3b6-86208d2675af)\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/a81e2ed5-814c-4590-b1bc-a8640a8d7e8d)\r\n\r\nExample output with alternative \"patch\" line and side-by-side.

        "Add new `TargetPlatform` property, to control the specific platform for the GE installer (.msi) package.\r\n\r\nCurrently the GE installer package is hard-coded to be built for the `x86` platform, with `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the default installation folder.  This makes sense to install it on the `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform, but a bit weird on `x64` (i.e. 64-bit) Windows platform (as discussed in #11554), and really feels weird when building an `Arm64-specific` installer package for Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nThis commit defines a new `TargetPlatform` property which can take the following values: `x64` (default), `x86`, or `arm64` (must be lower-case values, as required by Wix). This property is passed on to the `Platform` parameter for WiX to create relevant installer package specific to that platform. Like any other property, this `TargetPlatform` property can be specified on the command line to build a platform-specific installer, rather than using the default `x64` platform value.\r\n\r\nTo build GE, the current build command series still work as before:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj\r\ndotnet publish -c Release\r\n```\r\nand the following build artifacts are produced in the `artifacts\\Release\\publish` folder for the `x64` platform; for example:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform. It can be installed on Windows on Arm64 platform, as this platform contains translation layer for running `x64` program.\r\n\r\nIf the `TargetPlatform=x86` property value is specified in the `publish` command, like:\r\n```\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=x86\r\n```\r\nthen the following files are produced:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-x86-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `x86` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files (x86)` as the installation folder, and can install on `x86` (i.e. 32-bit) Windows, `x64` Windows and Windows on Arm64 platforms.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, to produce an `Arm64-specific` installer package, the following build commands should be executed on a Windows on Arm64 box:\r\n```\r\ndotnet build -c Release\r\ndotnet build -c Release scripts\\native.proj /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\ndotnet publish -c Release /p:TargetPlatform=arm64\r\n```\r\nand the following files will be produced for Arm64:\r\n```\r\nGitExtensions-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.msi\r\nGitExtensions-Portable-arm64-33.33.33.0-0e12afbf1.zip\r\n```\r\nThe above `arm64` installer (.msi) package will default to `C:\\Program Files` as the installation folder, and will refuse to install on any Windows platform except the Windows on Arm64 platform.\r\n\r\nFixes #9990\r\nFixes #11554\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology\r\n\r\n- default build GE installer for `x64` platform, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform (but none are available to test.)\r\n- build of `x86` platform GE installer, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=x86` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files (x86)` folder and works properly on x64 and/or Arm64 Windows platforms. It should work on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n- build GE installer for `Arm64` platform, by specifying the `TargetPlatform=arm64` property on the `publish` command, and check that it installs to the default `C:\\Program Files` folder and works properly on Arm64 Windows platform. Check that it should refuse to install on `x64` Windows platform. It should refuse to install on an x86 (i.e. 32-bit) Windows platform too, but none are available to test.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s)\r\n\r\n- Windows 10 & 11 on x64 platform\r\n- Windows 11 on Arm64 platform\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

Checking only the old menu item \"Show notes\" also shows notes ref.  Checking only the \"Show notes column\" item leads to displaynig notes text in columns and commit info, but hiding notes \"ref\".\r\n\r\nI`ve simplified the code a bit, now the CommitData and GitRevision classes have separate members for \"Body\" and \"Notes\". Parsing/re-formatting logic has been adjusted accordingly, code duplicates were not fixed in order to minimise footprint.\r\nThis change probably also fixes some potential bugs, as the notes are no longer part of the content of the message body internally.\r\n\r\n~Fixes #11413 \r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- \r\n- \r\n- \r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\nOriginally without the column (menu item un-checked). \r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/64522720/eb0c06b6-4d98-4590-b029-36b4f760322c)\r\n\r\n### After\r\nFeature turned on, notes not displayed in MessageColumn, but in the separate one.\r\nEither case, the notes are displayed in the \"commit info\" html pane, there`s plenty of space there.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/64522720/0e83984f-4121-4dda-acd2-faca4eb5bd5e)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- \r\n- \r\n- \r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT <!-- Add version 2.11 or above -->\r\n- Windows <!-- Add version 7 SP1 or above -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

(When working with this I have often used it to view worktree too.)\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-grep\r\n\r\nThe UI in this PR adds a popup as well as a searchbox to the Diff tab.\r\n\r\nThe searchbox dropdown has the search history for the GE session, not persistent.\r\nThe popup and searchbox are kept in sync.\r\n\r\nSearch in the popup is done when button is pressed (or Enter),\r\nthe diff tab box is searching when typing (similar in the filter).\r\nIf there is no `-e ` in the search string, this is added to the search string.\r\nMost git-grep options can be added, including  `--and` etc.\r\n\r\ngit-grep options to handle case insensitive is available, but most options can be added in the searchbox.\r\nPersistent options can be added too for instance `--show-function`.\r\n\r\nThe output of git-grep is always for a commit, including index and worktree.\r\nNote that the selected file in the grep group is not always followed when a new commit is selected, as it is not the primary group. This could be specially handled (but \"grep\" knowledge need to be added to RevDiff).\r\n\r\nPerformance\r\nIn the Git repo, the git-grep requires about 200 ms for me, the information is added async after normal diff so no visible.\r\nFor the Linux repo, git-grep can require several seconds. As the current search is aborted when a new is started, works fine for me.\r\nThe processing in the fileviewer is faster than for normal diffs.\r\n\r\nLimitations are basically the same as #11590 ,missing\r\n* Documentation for the changes, how colors etc can be changed by Git config\r\n* tests for the new functionality. May be postponed to a later PR\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\nThe popup window and the optional FileStatusList combobox\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/5d30eb67-2272-41ac-b5a8-d5d946311c3b)\r\n\r\nExample usage.\r\n![grep-example](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/6248932/f458a445-4104-4cec-8968-fe798dfe2afe)\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nsquash.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

So no checkedout tried to select a commit that no longer exists (unless it was an artificial commit).\r\nThere was an assert especially when opening an empty repo.\r\n\r\nSome comments:\r\n* The assert could be replaced with a Trace printout, the situation is handled\r\n* Selection could be kept if there is at least one artificial.\r\n* If no selection, artificial could be selected if shown.\r\n* As commented in the code:\r\n```\r\n            // This will assert if switching from one repo with no checkout but with a revision selected\r\n            // to a repo also without a checkout. This is handled below.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual\r\nI do not think a test is beneficial here.\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

(Even listing of tools fail, for instance when closing settings).\r\n* GE Settings cannot be read/write to local repo\r\n* Commands using the local .git config will not work.

Some changes are very minor like\r\nusing for instead of foreach, other changes the data structures.\r\n\r\nSeparate storage of nodes that has no GitRevision.\r\nThis allows to remove a separate node storage and\r\nto simplify the code.\r\n\r\nUse ImmutableArray instead of array and list for the ordered caches\r\nto improve allocations.\r\n\r\nForce update data grid when revision graph nodes have been modified\r\n\r\nThe order of nodes in the revision graph may change if the commits are\r\nlisted out of order or if artificial commits are inserted.\r\nThe revision graph was (normally) invalidated but the data grid was only\r\nrefreshed if scrolling.\r\n\r\nUse separate counter for revisions to limit\r\nthe lock time for _revisionByObjectId.Count\r\n\r\nRename variables and add comments\r\n\r\nRemove unused IsRevisionRelative().\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is partly a test of how you can use CoPilot to optimize code.\r\nIt is maybe 1/5 times you get something that works and 1/10 that something works.\r\nQuite often CoPilot insists on something that is not an improvement.\r\nBut that is not so bad, there are improvements in the end. \r\n\r\nThis code is running when revisions are loaded, so performance is important.\r\nAlso minor changes could make a difference.\r\n\r\nI will add some comments about decisions in an own review of the code.\r\n\r\nTests mostly on Linux repo, limiting loading to 100K commits.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the time RevisionDataGridView.Add() runs from about 1000-1400 ms to 400-600ms.\r\nHowever, the normal load time (as reported by RevisionReader) is mostly unchanged at 3000 - 3400 ms, so it seem like git-log delivers commits slower than they are handled here. \r\nThe total time for git-log to write to a file is about 1900 ms so there is something more to it, maybe something with reading the stream (there are changes in .NET7 I will try later).\r\nSo there may be a potential for some minor improvements later.\r\nThe decreased allocation seem to give more consistent running times (less gc).\r\n\r\nThe incorrect insertion of artificial commits (that #11266 made more visible) is fixed at least.\r\nI still get some visual issues when scrolling a lot, but better than before.\r\nSimilar with no grid when rebasing, I have not seen that lately.\r\nMore changes may be needed lock-cache-refresh handling, this is a step forward.\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nThere are tests for graph loading.\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

        "## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nHEAD may not be included in git-log in some scenarios. One example is an old checkout in the Linux repo where 100K commits is about a year. Another is when filtering.\r\n\r\nIn this scenario there is no HEAD the artificial commits cannot be inserted while loading.\r\nThe HEAD parents are then listed to find the first descendant in the grid, or first in the grid if no head parent is found.\r\n\r\nSimilar scenario for the revision to be reselected. When switching repo the HEAD is always selected.\r\n\r\nPreviously, a match was tried in all HEAD parents. This command requires 1.5 s in the linux repo,\r\ndelaying the the time until the spinner is dismissed. The number of parents to try is limited to around 50 ms instead.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the command ran a second time as the\r\nresult was not enumerated when trying to find the revision to select.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nThis is not a normal user problem, this is a \"cloning Linux a year ago and not checking out new branches\" problem.\r\nStill annoying when investigating other improvements.\r\n\r\nNote that Artificial are not inserted correctly after this, likely due to a timing problem.\r\nFixed in later PR.\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\nManual\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

The condition is based on whether the parameter is available, e.g. the script was executed from the diff view and any files are selected. Otherwise, the text in between is discarded. Also added `{ifnot:option}` for the opposite condition/fallback.\r\n- Added `ShowInFileList` event for showing an option directly in the context menu for file lists, and not in the `Run Scripts` submenu. Similar to `Show in RevisionGrid` for the revision grid.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/5435495/2fea70f7-dd4d-4017-b321-5e1455fb343e)\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/5435495/039e9ff2-88fa-4e5f-88e7-47d53b04b1c5)\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/5435495/d0a2041d-2e7e-4af4-a3a3-2d6197abedb3)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\n`Run Script` was only available in the revision grid, \r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\n`Run Script` is available in revision grid, diff file list, file tree, and commit file list (staged and unstaged).\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Added a test user script using all the new features (`notepad++.exe` `{if:SelectedFiles}{SelectedFiles} {if:LineNumber}-n{LineNumber}{/if}{/if}`)\r\n- Ran from the menu\r\n- Ran using a shortcut from multiple locations (revision tree, diff file list, file tree, commit window, diff view, blame view\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- Git Extensions 33.33.33\r\n- Build 98f366d73cb355b0d677a19edd5c36a57f5bcb6b\r\n- Git 2.42.0.windows.1\r\n- Microsoft Windows NT 10.0.19045.0\r\n- .NET 6.0.22\r\n- DPI 96dpi (no scaling)\r\n- Portable: False\r\n- Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App Versions\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.21 [D:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n    Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App 6.0.22 [D:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\shared\\Microsoft.WindowsDesktop.App]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Mention language, UI scaling, or anything else that might be relevant -->\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\n<!-- Change the following if the merge strategy should be changed:\r\n- Squash merge (maintainer to decide merge message, PR submitter should cleanup commits/messages at PR approval).\r\n- Rebase merge (PR submitter must change the commit message for the last commit).\r\n- Merge commit.

        "<!-- Please read CONTRIBUTING.md before submitting a pull request -->\r\n\r\n## Proposed changes\r\n\r\nThis adds a password input box below the console when running remote commands such as push/pull. This allows entering the password in a native control if one is required by the connection.\r\n\r\nIt is also usable for other input, like accepting server fingerprints, although the input is hidden regardless of the query.\r\n\r\n## Screenshots <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions/assets/5435495/fbfc1eaf-3d41-4cfd-b939-80f02dae6dad)\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\nIf using OpenSSH with the embedded console, direct typing and drag-and-drop may work, but the embedded console can corrupt input from auto-typers like KeePass. It also allows paste via Ctrl+V but not through right click/context menu.\r\n\r\nIf using OpenSSH with the emulated console, input isn't requested at all, and password input automatically fails.\r\n\r\nIf using Plink, password input automatically fails even in normal terminal. The only workaround is to use TortoisePlink which offers its own built-in password dialog.\r\n\r\n### After\r\n\r\nAn additional password input box is available underneath the console. It is possible to type into it, auto-type into it, paste into it (with Ctrl+V or right click menu), or drag and drop text into it. Upon pressing Enter, the text is fed into the console (including line feed).\r\n\r\nIn OpenSSH with embedded console, SSH may not allow password input through a pipe, so extra measures are taken to ensure it uses `SSH_ASKPASS` instead.\r\n\r\nPlink cannot be fixed. The only workaround is to use TortoisePlink.\r\n\r\n## Test methodology <!-- How did you ensure quality? -->\r\n\r\n- Made several pull requests to a password-protected SSH server, testing all possible combinations of SSH and console choice.\r\n\r\n## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->\r\n\r\n- GIT 2.41.0.windows.1\r\n- Windows 10.0.19045\r\n\r\n## Merge strategy\r\n\r\nI agree that the maintainer squash merge this PR (if the commit message is clear).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n:black_nib: I contribute this code under [The Developer Certificate of Origin](../blob/master/contributors.txt).\r\n",

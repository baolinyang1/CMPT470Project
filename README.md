## **Project Title**  
**Analyzing Pull Request Acceptance Rates**  

## **Summary**  
Study factors that influence the acceptance of pull requests in open-source projects.  

## **Impact/Implication**  
The acceptance of pull requests in open-source projects is influenced by various factors, including contributorrelated aspects like experience and activity history, which play a significant role in shaping trust and collaboration. Trends in acceptance rates over time, such as increased scrutiny before project releases, reveal how project phases affect decision-making. Additionally, review behaviors, such as the frequency and nature of comments, highlight the importance of collaborative feedback in improving pull request quality and influencing outcomes. These insights can guide contributors and maintainers in optimizing workflows and fostering effective collaboration.

## **Potential Research Questions** 
1. **How do contributor-related factors, such as experience and prior contributions, impact the acceptance
rates of pull requests in open-source projects?
2. **What is the influence of pull request attributes, such as code changes and review comments, on their
likelihood of acceptance?

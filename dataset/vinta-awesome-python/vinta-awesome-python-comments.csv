Can we get a merge, @vinta ðŸ™ƒ ?"

2514,closed,Add PDM to Package Management,2126681976,pawamoy,2024-05-23T09:45:29Z,"Unfortunately it doesn't look like @vinta has the capacity to groom the backlog of PRs. There are many no-brainers like this PR and [the one that adds Ruff](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/2292) that are waiting for a long time, with many upvotes, without being merged. PRs then [go stale](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/1412) (yay stale bots), are [re-opened](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/2551), and, strangely, sometimes [merged immediately with 0 upvote](https://github.com/vinta/awesome-python/pull/2578), while they are a duplicate of an older PR with more upvotes.

I'm not sure what the process is here, or if there's even one. It would be much more engaging if it was documented somewhere :thinking: I'm actually thinking about just closing this one for clean up.

Also, I invite everyone here to have a look at https://github.com/ml-tooling/best-of-python. Best-of lists are much more detailed than Awesome ones, and rank projects with a scoring algorithm. It could be nice to add PDM there too :man_shrugging: "
2514,closed,Add PDM to Package Management,2126697690,pawamoy,2024-05-23T09:53:37Z,"If @vinta ever adds a collaborator on the repository to help them with maintenance, someone please let me know, and I'll reopen (if needed).

(By the way I'm willing to help with maintenance. Not for eternity, but I can seriously groom the backlog in a short period. I'm well versed in the Python ecosystem. I'd merge the no-brainers, and close duplicate quickly. I won't blindly merge something I don't know just because of upvotes, which in some cases seem fake)"

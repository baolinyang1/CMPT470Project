You come to no-login-web-apps repo, look up the index and quickly find something that works for you, out of the box. No logins, no registrations. Of course, if you will be doing this too often, you might want to create an account on that site.

> I honestly rather create an account in a great web app then use a crappy one without login

**From README:** Most of the apps mentioned here do provide some kind of a user account feature to save history and progress. But as already stated before, a user account is not necessary to use the main features of these apps.

Maybe I should add a marker for sites that allow logins ?

How is my list different?
Well, there are open source app lists. My list is for free apps that means the app can be open-source or closed source. The listen only contains the best free apps that can have their source code public or private.

I put it in three topics as the list covers windows, mac and linux. There are no free app lists currently, so I made one."
3308,closed,Add Free Apps,2549469055,Mo-way,2024-12-17T19:48:40Z,"@Axorax 
The free needs more clear, because (software) people differentiate `free as in freedom` and `free as in free beer`. 
See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre

Awesome to see the resonance to your list! It seems there's definitely a desire for a ""gratis"" apps list, regardless the freedom of the source code. Still, I think adding it in one category only suffices.. All other ""free apps"" related lists are in `Miscellaneous` (apart from the macOS one, for obvious reasons)."

Although it overlaps a bit with what you mentioned earlier, here are my thoughts:

1. Regarding “⭐ recommended by us,” I think it would be better to either clarify the criteria for recommendation or remove it altogether if there aren’t any explicit standards. The awesome list itself is already about listing only ‘awesome’ things. Of course, if you want to highlight the most awesome among the awesome ones, then it could still make sense to include it.
2. What is the criteria for labeling something as a free app? Platforms like Steam or Xbox seem a bit ambiguous to be categorized as “free apps.”

Hope this feedback helps!"

Rule 1 of the guidelines: Don't open a Draft / WIP pull request while you work on the guidelines. A pull request should be 100% ready and should adhere to all the guidelines when you open it

So it doesnt seem like you actually read it. When reading, also follow the links the guidelines contain."

1) I do not think that this is an ""Awesome"" list. I mean that creating a single repository to include all the FOSS Alternatives is somehow a ""utopia"". In fact all of the Awesome lists included on this project are (kind of) FOSS related.
2) Even if the No1 is not correct the list is too poor to be an ""awesome"". It misses known entries.
3) The sections are too generic. This is due to No1 above. For example the section ""System Services"" (where you mention Mobile App repository services) should be named ""Digital software distribution platform"".
4) The sections are not in alphabetical order so navigating through them is too hard to accomplish.
5) There are already similar Awesome lists (some of them are also included on this project):

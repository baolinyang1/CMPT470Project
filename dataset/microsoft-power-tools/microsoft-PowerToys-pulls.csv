## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This PR adds an additional property to the `Result.cs` model which allows for disabling the functionality which fetches the `SelectedCount` data from PowerToys. This enables the ability for plugins to prevent the `SelectedCount` property from being populated for individual results meaning that the sort order can be manipulated as desired by the Plugin giving more control back to the plugin developers.

## Summary of the Pull Request
Added a function to the PowerToys Run calculator plugin to allow for a value to be treated as a certain angle unit. For example,  in `rad(pi / 2)`, `pi / 2` is treated as being in radians, which need converting to the user selected unit.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
Added conversion functions for the PowerToys Run Calculator plugin. This allows the use of `rad`, `deg`, and `grad` to specify how to interpret a value. For example, `rad(pi / 2)` would treat the value `pi / 2` as being in radians, and convert it to the angle unit currently selected as default in the settings, by prepending the mathematical conversion (e.g. `(180 / pi) *`). This allows for quick conversions between the different angle units.

37455,[CI] fix: Use Azure CLI for artifact download to prevent OutOfMemory issues,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
**PR Description:**  

This PR follows up on [[#37403](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/37403)], which provided a quick fix for OutOfMemory issues when downloading artifacts on ARM agents.  

### Changes in this PR:  
1. **Use Azure CLI for artifact download** – Since the agent lacks the required environment, use the Azure CLI ZIP, which includes Python.
2. **Revert filtering of certain PDB files** – The OneFuzz pipeline requires these files, so the previous filtering changes have been reverted.  

**Tested in the pipeline and confirmed working successfully.**

37427,[KeyboardManager WinUI3] Create WinUI3 project and wrapper for Keyboard Manager Editor,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
Initial PR to create placeholder projects for the Keyboard Manager WinUI3 C#/XAML migration. No impact to current software UX.

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->
## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

1. Set up the `KeyboardManagerEditorUI` project for the WinUI3 C#/XAML Editor UI.
2. Create C++ DLL Wrapper project `KeyboardManagerEditorLibraryWrapper` to decouple the WinUI3 rendering code from the backscene logic in current WinUI2 code. This is to leverage the current Library without affecting existing logic, ensuring a safe rollout and facilitating future WinUI2 code migration/clean up.
3. Enable C# `logging` for the WinUI3 Editor.
4. Add a mock registry value `UseNewEditor` for the A/B editor switcher to make sure upcoming port work does not impact any existing user experiences. This registry value is intended for development purpose only and doesn't exist in the system. Once the migration is complete, we can remove this dev registry and use the PowerToys experimentation toggle for a safe release.

37373,[ImageResizer] Fix issues with blank Width and Height controls,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
This fixes some related issues with the Width and Height NumberBox controls for the Custom preset. The issues were:
1. Users could not clear existing numbers from the field and move away from the field without a databinding error being displayed. (Red border.)
2. Settings were not saved if Width or Height were blank, leading to the _previous_ value for that dimension being used in the resize operation. This would result in incorrect sizes for the resulting image, and the UI not showing the actual value used.
3. Empty/auto values were not saved to the settings file, meaning the previous value of Width or Height was loaded in again when Image Resizer was re-launched.

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->
## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

The issue centred around the fact that emptying a NumberBox bound to a non-nullable double value will result in a data binding error because the empty control now has a null `Value`.

Inputting 0 into the fields instead of clearing them completely is fine and would be reasonable as a workaround, but this does not reflect the description of the feature on the Image Resizer help page, which specifically mentions that one or the other dimension field may be left blank to take advantage of the auto-scaling functionality.

The solution is to translate empty strings to 0, _but not to display 0 in the UI_. This is achieved through combining a NumberFormatter and a ValueConverter:
- The NumberFormatter ensures that if the control has a value of 0, it will display an empty string.
- The ValueConverter ensures that when the user clears the NumberBox or inputs an expression that evaluates to an invalid input, that 0 is always set as the result.

Without the ValueConverter, the data binding step would fail because `null` is the value of a cleared NumberBox and we would be attempting to bind to `ResizeSize.Width` or `ResizeSize.Height`, which are non-nullable.

There are likely some alternative methods to get around this, perhaps by using `double.NaN` instead of 0, or changing Width and Height to nullable. However, relying on the ValueConverter and NumberFormatter means that we do not need to change the underlying types, and this was seen as lower risk.

I made a few changes and added comments to AutoDoubleConverter.cs. This was because I initially thought I could use it on the custom preset's Width and Height fields, before deciding to create a new Converter made specifically to resolve the issue at hand. Also, I took the opportunity to make it more defensive in terms of type handling by using pattern matching. The functionality is identical.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

The application was manually tested both via the command line and by running directly from Visual Studio (which opens up the file picker because there is no file pre-selected).

Tested that:
- Width and Height NumberBoxes may now be empty, and no error is reported when they are in this state.
- When Width or Height is set to (auto) by blanking it out, the other dimension is used correctly to resize the image. The previous value of the now-blank field is not used.
- If ""0"" is input manually into either field, it is updated to be an empty string when focus moves from the control, keeping the UI consistent.
- The empty value is persisted to the settings file and is reloaded correctly when the application is re-launched. (An empty value is saved as ""0"".)
- A variety of file types are supported (sanity check - I did not test all supported types).
- **(auto)** text appears in the list of presets where one dimension has not been provided.
- The specific steps detailed in the original Issues no longer appear.
- All unit tests still pass.
- The Settings page for Image Resizer is still correct.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

### IsSystemDarkMode()
Prior to this fix, the code for detecting Dark mode looked like this:

``` csharp
private static bool IsSystemDarkMode()
{
    const string registryKey = @""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize"";
    const string registryValue = ""AppsUseLightTheme"";

    // Retrieve the registry value, which is a DWORD (0 or 1)
    object registryValueObj = Registry.GetValue(registryKey, registryValue, null);
    if (registryValueObj != null)
    {
        // 0 = Dark mode, 1 = Light mode
        bool isLightMode = Convert.ToBoolean((int)registryValueObj, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        return !isLightMode; // Invert because 0 = Dark
    }
    else
    {
        // Default to Light theme if the registry key is missing
        return false; // Default to dark mode assumption
    }
}
```

The following line is flawed:

``` csharp
bool isLightMode = Convert.ToBoolean((int)registryValueObj, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
```

Specifically, the int cast on `registryValueObj` can fail if the object is not convertible to an `int`.

The boolean conversion is unnecessary, too, as the value can be compared to 0, which represents the Dark theme.

The method is called by GetCurrentTheme to determine what app theme is active, so there is actually no need to return a bool; we can simply return the theme directly. With this in mind, we can change the method to:

```csharp
    internal Theme GetAppsTheme()
    {
        try
        {
            // A 0 for this registry value represents Dark mode. If the value could not be
            // retrieved or is the wrong type, we default to Light mode.
            var regValue = _registryService.GetValue(PersonalizeKey, ""AppsUseLightTheme"", 1);
            return regValue is int intValue && intValue == 0 ? Theme.Dark : Theme.Light;
        }
        catch
        {
            return Theme.Light;
        }
    }
```

The method is renamed GetAppsTheme, which reflects its updated purpose. (Also the method was never about checking the **System** theme, but the **Apps** theme.) This now uses a pattern-matching `is` instead of `Convert` to better handle nulls and incompatible types. A defensive try/catch has been added because `Registry.GetValue()` may theoretically throw. The method is internal and registry access is done through a new service class because of the new unit testing additions, which are discussed later. Finally, the const registry key string is now declared earlier in the file, together with its counterpart for GetHighContrastBaseType.

### GetHighContrastBaseType()

Before this PR, the method looked like this:

```csharp
    public static Theme GetHighContrastBaseType()
    {
        const string registryKey = @""HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes"";
        const string registryValue = ""CurrentTheme"";

        string themePath = (string)Registry.GetValue(registryKey, registryValue, string.Empty);
        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(themePath))
        {
            return Theme.Light; // Default to light theme if missing
        }

        string theme = themePath.Split('\\').Last().Split('.').First().ToLowerInvariant();

        return theme switch
        {
            ""hc1"" => Theme.HighContrastOne,
            ""hc2"" => Theme.HighContrastTwo,
            ""hcwhite"" => Theme.HighContrastWhite,
            ""hcblack"" => Theme.HighContrastBlack,
            _ => Theme.Light,
        };
    }
```

There is a complicating factor here in that `Theme.Light` is being used as a return value to represent the case when no matching High Contrast theme was found. This makes GetCurrentTheme difficult to decipher, as `Theme.Light` is used as both a guard/default value and as an actual _valid_ value for the apps theme. To fix this, I changed the method to return `null` if no match was found.

I also replaced

```csharp
themePath.Split('\\').Last().Split('.').First().ToLowerInvariant();
```

with

```csharp
Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension(themePath)
```

because the values do represent actual file paths.

The `switch` code was replaced with a case-insensitive culture-invariant lookup into a Dictionary, and the method was renamed GetHighContrastTheme. The BaseType suffix from before didn't seem to reflect the return type.

### GetCurrentTheme()
The change to return `null` from `GetHighContrastTheme` and the actual theme value from `GetAppsTheme` means we can change `GetCurrentTheme` from:

``` csharp
    public static Theme GetCurrentTheme()
    {
        // Check for high-contrast mode
        Theme highContrastTheme = GetHighContrastBaseType();
        if (highContrastTheme != Theme.Light)
        {
            return highContrastTheme;
        }

        // Check if the system is using dark or light mode
        return IsSystemDarkMode() ? Theme.Dark : Theme.Light;
    }
```

to

```csharp
    public Theme GetCurrentTheme() => GetHighContrastTheme() ?? GetAppsTheme();
```

This more accurately represents what the method is doing - it looks for an active High Contrast theme, and if no match is found, it returns the preferred Dark/Light theme for apps.

### ThemeManager Updates

UpdateTheme could be simplified by taking into account the fact that GetCurrentTheme already does a check for the High Contrast theme. It can be changed from:

```csharp
        public void UpdateTheme()
        {
            ManagedCommon.Theme newTheme = _settings.Theme;
            ManagedCommon.Theme theme = ThemeExtensions.GetHighContrastBaseType();
            if (theme != ManagedCommon.Theme.Light)
            {
                newTheme = theme;
            }
            else if (_settings.Theme == ManagedCommon.Theme.System)
            {
                newTheme = ThemeExtensions.GetCurrentTheme();
            }

            _mainWindow.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
            {
                SetSystemTheme(newTheme);
            });
        }
```

to:

```csharp
        public void UpdateTheme()
        {
            Theme newTheme = _settings.Theme == Theme.System ?
                _themeHelper.GetCurrentTheme() :
                _settings.Theme;

            _mainWindow.Dispatcher.Invoke(() =>
            {
                SetSystemTheme(newTheme);
            });
        }
```

Some minor refactoring to ThemeManager.cs, including:
- Removed `ManagedCommon` prefix from many places. There was already a `using` for this namespace, making them redundant.
- Changed a couple of instances of pattern matching against `Theme` values to be straight equality comparisons, which is more idiomatic. For example:

```csharp
Color = theme is ManagedCommon.Theme.Dark ? (Color)ColorConverter.ConvertFromString(""#202020"") : (Color)ColorConverter.ConvertFromString(""#fafafa"")
```

was changed to:

```csharp
Color = (Color)ColorConverter.ConvertFromString(theme == Theme.Dark ? ""#202020"" : ""#fafafa"")
```

- Made `CurrentTheme` an auto property, as it doesn't need a backing field.
- Removed test code and comment (`ResourceDictionary test = new ResourceDictionary...`).
- Removed the `Theme.Light` and `Theme.Dark` mappings in the `switch`, as this is the `else` block after they are specifically checked for in the `if`, so they will never match.
- Changed the High Contrast switch's default value to `Theme.Light` so issues are more visible should a new HC mode be added but not correctly matched.
- Added a reference to `ThemeHelper`, as it's no longer a static class because of the updates for unit testing. Speaking of unit tests...

### Unit Tests
There were no tests for the theme-related methods, so this PR:
- Adds a new IRegistryService interface and default RegistryService class which replicates the existing Win32 Registry access.
- Adds a RegistryServiceFactory which creates a new RegistryService instance for use by ThemeHelper.
- Adds a constructor to ThemeHelper which takes an IRegistryService instance or uses the factory to create the default.
- Mocks the Registry for the unit tests, which are new and can be found in Wox.Test.ThemeHelperTest.cs.

### Finallly
- Renamed ThemeExtensions.cs to ThemeHelper.cs. The file does not contain extension methods.
- Added XML comments to all public and internal methods updated in this PR.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

New unit tests which exercise `ThemeHelper` methods directly.

### Manual tests
The application responds correctly when:
- The theme is changed between Dark and Light modes in Windows' Personalisation settings.
- A High Contrast theme is selected through Accessibility > Contrast themes.
- The user overrides the system or app settings through the PowerToys Settings app.",open,2025-02-06T11:30:47Z,,,,main,run-theme-detect,7,426,104,5,5,0,"mantaionut, daverayment, daverayment, daverayment, mantaionut","COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, APPROVED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/37324

## Summary of the Pull Request

When installing as user and then updating, the Win11 context menus msix entries aren't properly updated, meaning the context menu entries won't appear.
This PR checks if the package is at the right version or it will still run the msix install logic.
It also allows updating to older versions in the case of downgrades, just in case.

### Added support for variables in template filenames
Variables supported includes
1. Date and time component variables, such as `$YYYY`, `$YY`, `$MM`, `$DD`, - using the same syntax and implementation as in PowerRename
2. `$PARENT_FOLDER_NAME` - will replace variable with the name of the parent folder
3. `%environment-variable%` - will replace variable with the value of the corresponding environment variable

Example:
Template filename:
`$YYYY-$MM-%DD, $hh - $PARENT_FOLDER_NAME by %USERNAME%`

Filename on create becomes:
`2025-01-25, 02 - PowerShell project by cgaarden`

## Summary of the Pull Request

When selecting a file through ZoomIt settings page, that would change the current working directory of the Settings process and would disable functionality like opening the KBM editor.

The reason for this is that the `GetOpenFileName` API changes the current process current working directory.
This PR adds a flag to disable that behavior.

Reason why `GetOpenFileName` has this default behavior:

37042,[ZoomIt]Fix transparent draw after changing another setting,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request

While testing the release candidate with ZoomIt, we found an error that caused the draw mode to not work after changing a Setting.
It turns out we were missing the code that sets opacity after loading the settings from PowerToys.
This PR adds that code.

This PR also identifies some other settings that are used internally by ZoomIt as state only and removes them from the settings the Settings application knows, so that we don't keep status for those while manipulating other settings and end up overwriting the changes the running ZoomIt has done to that internal state.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
1 - Start ZoomIt.
2 - Verify Draw works.
3 - Change any Setting.
4 - Verify Draw still works. (Before this fix it would try to draw with transparent ink)
5 - Change pen color (Press G or B in draw mode for Green or Blue, for example)
6 - Try to change any Setting.
7 - Enter draw mode and verify your color change is still remembered.

## Validation Steps Performed

### Run manual tests from [Test Checklist Template](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/5bc7201ae2b75b53d3a4bc35119c867ecf71c5f6/doc/releases/tests-checklist-template.md#mouse-without-borders):

* Install PowerToys on two PCs in the same local network:
   - [x] Verify that PowerToys is properly installed on both PCs.
   
 * Setup Connection:
   - [x] Open MWB's settings on the first PC and click the ""New Key"" button. Verify that a new security key is generated.
   - [x] Copy the generated security key and paste it in the corresponding input field in the settings of MWB on the second PC. Also enter the name of the first PC in the required field.
   - [x] Press ""Connect"" and verify that the machine layout now includes two PC tiles, each displaying their respective PC names.
   
 * Verify Connection Status:
   - [x] Ensure that the border of the remote PC turns green, indicating a successful connection.
   - [x] Enter an incorrect security key and verify that the border of the remote PC turns red, indicating a failed connection.
   
 * Test Remote Mouse/Keyboard Control:
   - [x] With the PCs connected, test the mouse/keyboard control from one PC to another. Verify that the mouse/keyboard inputs are correctly registered on the other PC.
   - [ ] Test remote mouse/keyboard control across all four PCs, if available. Verify that inputs are correctly registered on each connected PC when the mouse is active there.
     - unable to test - only 2 machines available
   
 * Test Remote Control with Elevated Apps:
   - note - the main PowerToys.exe must be running as a **non**-admin for these tests
   - [x] Open an elevated app on one of the PCs. Verify that without ""Use Service"" enabled, PowerToys does not control the elevated app.
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings (need to run PowerToys.exe as admin to enable ""Use Service"", then restart PowerToys.exe as non-admin). Verify that PowerToys can now control the elevated app remotely. Verify that MWB processes are running as LocalSystem, while the MWB helper process is running non-elevated.
     - ```get-process -Name ""PowerToys.MouseWithoutBorders*"" -IncludeUserName | format-table Id, ProcessName, UserName```
     - [x] Process: ```PowerToys.MouseWithoutBorders.exe``` - running as ```SYSTEM```
     - [x] Process: ```PowerToys.MouseWithoutBorders.Helper.exe``` - running as current user
     - ```get-service -Name ""PowerToys.*"" | ft Status, Name, UserName; get-ciminstance -Class ""Win32_Service"" -Filter ""Name like 'PowerToys%'"" | ft ProcessId, Name```
     - [x] Service: ```PowerToys.MWB.Service``` - running as ```Local System```
   - [x] Toggle ""Use Service"" again, verify that each time you do that, the MWB processes are restarted.
   - [x] Run PowerToys elevated on one of the machines, verify that you can control elevated apps remotely now on that machine.

* Test Module Enable Status:
   - [x] For all combinations of ""Use Service""/""Run PowerToys as admin"", try enabling/disabling MWB module and verify that it's indeed being toggled using task manager.
   
 * Test Disconnection/Reconnection:
   - [ ] Disconnect one of the PCs from network. Verify that the machine layout updates to reflect the disconnection. 
   - [x] Do the same, but now by exiting PowerToys.
   - [x] Start PowerToys again, verify that the PCs are reconnected.
  
 * Test Various Local Network Conditions:
   - [ ] Test MWB performance under various network conditions (e.g., low bandwidth, high latency). Verify that the tool maintains a stable connection and functions correctly.

 * Clipboard Sharing:
   - [x] Copy some text on one PC and verify that the same text can be pasted on another PC.
   - [x] Use the screenshot key and Win+Shift+S to take a screenshot on one PC and verify that the screenshot can be pasted on another PC.
   - [ ] Copy a file in Windows Explorer and verify that the file can be pasted on another PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] Try to copy multiple files and directories and verify that it's not possible (only the first selected file is being copied).
 
 * Drag and Drop:
   - [ ] Drag a file from Windows Explorer on one PC, cross the screen border onto another PC, and release it there. Verify that the file is copied to the other PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] While dragging the file, verify that a corresponding icon is displayed under the mouse cursor.
   - [ ] Without moving the mouse from one PC to the target PC, press CTRL+ALT+F1/2/3/4 hotkey to switch to the target PC directly and verify that file sharing/dropping is not working.

 * Lock and Unlock with ""Use Service"" Enabled:
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings.
   - [x] Lock a remote PC using Win+L, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can unlock the remote PC.
   - [x] Disable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings, lock the remote PC, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can't unlock the remote PC.

 * Test Settings:
   - [ ] Change the rest of available settings on MWB page and verify that each setting works as described.

### Group Policy Tests

- [ ] Install *.admx / *.adml and check settings behave as expected
  - [ ] I'll expand the list of settings here when I get this far :-)

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

### Accessibility Updates
- Added accessible name for the image size preset settings card group, giving additional context to the Add button when it is narrated.
- Replaced the Add button's ""Add new size"" accessible name with ""Add new preset"", as suggested.
- Added dynamic Name and FullDescription accessible fields for Edit and Remove buttons. Instead of just being ""Edit"" and ""Remove"", the Name properties now also refer to the preset name, e.g. ""Edit the Small preset"". New description fields give a complete summary of all the preset properties, e.g. ""Removes the Large preset, which fits to 1920 by 1080 pixels"".

### Preset Descriptions fix
- Fixed the fit and unit text being absent in the card description field.
- Refactored `ImageResizerFitToStringConverter` and `ImageResizerUnitToStringConverter` to create lookups instead of querying for the resource on every call.

### Localization
- Renamed ""EditButton"" to ""ImageResizer_EditButton"" in resources and XAML, to align with other names and to reduce the risk of future conflicts with control IDs on other settings pages.
- ImageResizerPage should not have to know the localized default name for adding a new image size preset. This has been made a default in the view model instead.

### ViewModel Fixes and Refactor
- Backing fields were directly set to the settings values. The public property names are now used consistently, following best practice.
- `SavesImageSizes()` saved the settings to the ""sizes.json"" file _before_ updating the settings value itself. This may have resulted in issues where adding a new preset, not changing any of its properties, then closing/navigating away would not save the new item in ""sizes.json"", even though it would be correctly saved in ""settings.json"".
- Hard-coded values for new preset properties removed. These are now taken from `Settings.Properties.ImageresizerCustomSize` instead.
- `EncoderGuid` lookup added, replacing repeated if-else code in `GetEncoderGuid()` and `GetEncoderIndex()`.
- Various assignments between the observable `Sizes` property and its backing field or temporary variables have been removed and replaced with a centralised `CollectionChanged` handler. For example, `SizePropertyChanged` was:

``` csharp
    public void SizePropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        ImageSize modifiedSize = (ImageSize)sender;
        ObservableCollection<ImageSize> imageSizes = Sizes;
        imageSizes.First(x => x.Id == modifiedSize.Id).Update(modifiedSize);
        _advancedSizes = imageSizes;
        SavesImageSizes(imageSizes);
    }
```
		
and can now be reduced to:
	
``` csharp
    public void SizePropertyChanged(object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        SaveImageSizes();
    }
```
	
- Renamed the `Sizes` observable collection backing field to `_sizes` from `_advancedSizes`.
- Refactored repeated property setting code into a new `SetProperty()` function.
- Removed saving to ""sizes.json"" in the `Encoder` setter. The encoder guid is not saved in that file. It is still saved in ""settings.json"" in `SetProperty()`.
- Renamed `AddRow()` to more descriptive `AddImageSize()`. This also matches the existing `DeleteImageSize()`.
- Fixed the `PropertyChanged` event handler not being cleaned up when deleting a size preset, in `DeleteImageSize()`. Subscribing and unsubscribing is now handled in new methods `SubscribeToItemPropertyChanged()` and `UnsubscribeFromPropertyChanged()`, keeping this related code together.
- Slightly simplified `GenerateNameForNewSize()`.

### ImageSize Fixes and Refactor
- `Update()` is not required and has been removed. Dependency properties are correctly defined for the bound fields already.
- Removed parameterless constructor and added constructor parameter defaults instead.
- Refactored repeated property setting code into a `SetProperty()` function.
- Added [JsonIgnore] to fields which were not meant to be serialized.
- Removed unused `ExtraBoxOpacity` field.
- Renamed `EnableEtraBoxes` (sic) to `IsHeightUsed`, better reflecting its usage.

### AIW Tests
Confirmed new accessibility values were present by using Accessibility Insights for Windows:

- New group Name and updated add button Name:

### Other Tests

Tested that:
- The fit and unit descriptions were now correctly displayed with the width and height information.

- Properties were correctly persisted to both ""sizes.json"" and ""settings.json"" files.
- The old JSON files were correctly read, i.e. the now-ignored properties in ImageSize do not cause any issues.
- Different formats are correctly used for whether the height property is being used in the preset.
- Deleting size presets at the beginning, middle and end of the list do not cause issues and the list is reloaded in the same order when navigating away from the page and back again.
- Adding a new size preset shows the custom width and height, not the same values as the Small preset.

36892,[MWB] Fix helper process termination issue in service mode,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request

This PR addresses an issue reported in #30259, where running MWB (Mouse Without Borders) in service mode causes the helper process to remain terminated at various points, resulting in functionalities such as clipboard sharing becoming non-functional.

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->
## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

When MWB is launched in service mode, events such as desktop switches (e.g., UAC prompts) cause the helper process to be killed and subsequently restarted. To restart the helper process within the user's desktop session, the `CreateProcessInInputDesktopSession` method uses APIs such as `WTSQueryUserToken`, which require privileges and the LocalSystem account to function properly.
Link to the relevant code:
https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/315059fc3be030cdd3b69b846d3f09ac108fffd1/src/modules/MouseWithoutBorders/App/Class/Common.Launch.cs#L88-L202

However, in the scenario where this issue occurs, the main thread is impersonated with user-level permissions, causing these API calls to fail. As a result, the helper process remains terminated, and features like clipboard sharing stop working.

Through debugging, I found that the execution permissions of the main thread are impersonated (and not reverted) after a delegate is invoked via `DoSomethingInUIThread` from other threads (e.g., `InputCallback Thread`). The root cause of this behavior is unknown at this time, but I personally feel like it's due to a framework-side issue rather than an implementation issue.

After experimenting with several approaches, I discovered that suppressing the flow of the execution context in the calling thread (using `ExecutionContext.SuppressFlow();`) before invoking `DoSomethingInUIThread` prevents this issue. Given that suppressing the execution context flow from non-main threads does not appear to pose any problems in the current MWB implementation, this PR applies this fix.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

1. Launch MWB in service mode and move the mouse cursor.
2. Trigger desktop switch events such as displaying a UAC prompt or pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
3. After returning to the original desktop, confirm that the helper process is restarted and that clipboard sharing functionality continues to operate as expected.",closed,2025-01-15T17:14:24Z,2025-01-22T18:14:49Z,2025-01-22T18:14:49Z,In for .88,main,feature/fix-helper-process-exit,4,40,0,6,6,2,"jaimecbernardo, jaimecbernardo","CHANGES_REQUESTED, APPROVED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/36892
36890,[Peek]Fix using the correct Monaco assets at runtime,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request

After https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/commit/20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86, when trying to run Peek Monaco preview on a release installer, there's a crash on WebView 2.
This seems to be caused by the MonacoHelper not recognizing it's on the WinUI3Apps directory.
`Path.GetDirectoryName(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)` was replaced by `AppContext.BaseDirectory` on https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/commit/20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86 , but the latter includes a stray directory separator at the end that must be removed for the remaining logic to make sense.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
Built a release installer and tested Monaco on both Peek and the file preview handler.

## Summary of the Pull Request

After https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/commit/20a5f67222f74c687a08aa4d3bf1ba8c978faf86 , the option to ""Try to format the source for preview"" started failing for json files in both the dev file preview handler and when previewing json files in Peek.

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->
## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This fixes two issues:
1 - `[JsonSourceGenerationOptions(WriteIndented = true)]` was not applied, so used `WriteIndented = true,` in the `JsonSerializerOptions` like it was before the AOT changes to make it work.
2 - After the first fix, the Json formatting was being applied only once, creating an error in the logs:
```
[Error] MonacoHelper::InitializeIndexFileAndSelectedFile
    Failed to apply formatting
System.InvalidOperationException: JsonSerializerOptions instances cannot be modified once encapsulated by a JsonSerializerContext. Such encapsulation can happen either when calling 'JsonSerializerOptions.AddContext' or when passing the options instance to a JsonSerializerContext constructor.

So, I've created a singleton `FilePreviewJsonSerializerContext` as well, since it seems the static `JsonSerializerOptions` can only be used once to create the `FilePreviewJsonSerializerContext`.

36858,[Advanced Paste] Use background thread for interactions between runner and Advanced Paste,"## Summary of the Pull Request
Before this change, the runner blocks on the Advanced Paste process connecting to the named pipe that it creates for communication. This slows down the PowerToys start-up routine and can hang PowerToys when the Advanced Paste process hangs or crashes.

This change fixes this issue by using a dedicated background thread (with a task queue) for all interactions between the runner and Advanced Paste.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
- Extracted code for runner-Advanced Paste interaction (launch / exit process, create named pipe, send messages, bring process to front) to a separate type.
- Made interactions non-blocking by using `src\common\utils\OnThreadExecutor.h`
- Added extra routine to consider Advanced Paste dead and kill it if it hasn't connected to named pipe in 5 seconds.
- Made other miscellaneous improvements to code (refactoring, hardening, improved logging).

## Validation Steps Performed
- With Advanced Paste enabled, verify can bring up window via hotkey and  send other app hotkeys.
- Enable, disable, enable Advanced Paste from settings, verify can bring up window via hotkey.
- Kill Advanced Paste process from Process Explorer, verify can bring up window via hotkey.
- Simulate Advanced Paste process not connecting to named pipe, slow to start-up, dies after a few messages. Verify can bring up window via hotkey. Verify PowerToys / Settings does not hang.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

**List of all new features:**
- View notes hierarchically (called notebook explorer)
	- This allows users to open all item types (not just pages) in OneNote from PTRun.
- Quickly create new notebooks, section groups, sections and pages.
- Search items by their title only.
- Search pages only in a specific notebook, section group or section.
- View recently edited pages.
- New icons (option to match PowerToys theme or use colored icons).
- The ability to see whether an item has unread changes.

**This adds new plugin specific keywords:**
| Keyword | Description  |
|--------------|------------------|
| `nb:\`  | Access the notebook explorer  |
| `rp:`  | Quickly view recent pages  |
| `*`  | Search items by title  | 
| `>`  | Search pages within an item (Only works in notebook explorer) |


**New settings:**
- Show an icon for items with unread changes.
- Show encrypted sections (even if they are unlocked)
- Show the recycle bin section group
- Create coloured icons for notebooks and sections
- COM Object timeout.
	- The delay before the COM object is removed from memory after user input. Creating a COM object is a slow process.
	- This setting is fine left as default, so can potential be removed if too confusing.
	- This is a work around given there is no api to know when the run window is opened or closed.


 
This also changes package dependencies, one of them is that LazyCache is not used so the lines mention below may not be needed any more.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
- Paste actions now have their text and Ctrl+Num shortcut correctly read out by screen readers.
- Paste actions now work with keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter, space).
- The following items now also work correctly with screen readers:
  - Clipboard history items (including images)
  - Clipboard history more options button
  - Thumbs up/down buttons
- Many other extra description texts have been provided which do not seem to have functional impact when using Narrator in default mode, but will possibly improve descriptions in higher verbosity settings.
- Paste Formats now use a `PasteFormatTemplateSelector` that more explicitly indicates disabled items.

## Validation Steps Performed
Tested changes using Narrator (default settings) and performed a sanity check.

## Summary of the Pull Request
**Root cause**
The root cause of  the issue is that during the execution of the localization pipeline, some already localized files were downloaded. However, when the service failed and triggered a retry, the regex used to search for all resource files also included the downloaded files. 
this pipeline caused the issue: https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/Dart/_build/results?buildId=112645818&view=results
The request failed, as shown in the image below:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35edae82-e71f-4e2b-a963-458498fb125d)
Here, localized files start to be incorrectly used by TDBuild.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c6358bb-d509-4e97-bf06-175271a22a02)

ICM: https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v5/incidents/details/576641069/summary

**PR fix**
This fix addresses the issue by excluding the output folder from the source path regex.

## Summary of the Pull Request

When opening the list of language selection of Quick Accent on Settings, the first load selects all the languages one by one, triggering a save everytime, meaning the saved state might get into a state where some of the languages are missing.
This PR guards against triggering the ""selctionChanged"" event if all we're doing is the first load.

It also adds a check against loading a non existing language and adding a null entry to the loaded array after LINQ.

## Summary of the Pull Request

Replace the current `WarnIfElevationIsRequired` inline function  with a proper helper class that uses `FileWatcher`.
The new helper allows to cache the option and uses the `FileWatcher` to listen for changes in the general settings JSON.
It will prevent AOT and FZ to constantly read the general settings JSON.

Note that `WarnIfElevationIsRequired` is also used by the Workspaces snapshot tool but only once.

The Mages dep has been recently upgraded to v3.0.0, introducing support for octal numbers and hence requiring this PR. Therefore it would be great if it got merged in this release cycle, so that there wouldn't be a release with v3.0.0 that doesn't properly support it.

36665,Quick Accent: Add currencies to VK_3 and VK_4 (most commonly used keys for currencies) ,"## Summary of the Pull Request
Added currencies to VK_3 and VK_4 (the most commonly used keys for currencies) and a couple of other minor currency updates - added £ to VK_L (base character) and VK_E (similar-presenting character), ¤ (generic currency symbol) to VK_O, and ₿ (bitcoin symbol) to VK_B. Few things were mapped to 3 and 4, so the lists aren't long even with the whole set of currency characters added. 

Built and verified updates worked as expected.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

Note: I'd investigated attempting to determine whether a virtual key represented a currency symbol to dynamically show the additional currency symbols only in that event. However, there wasn't a straightforward way to accomplish that and it would require significant changes to the application's structure to implement. 

## Validation Steps Performed
Built and manually verified that the additional characters appeared and were output following the update.

This PR implements a website link and the plugin version into the plugin metadata line visible in PT Run settings.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This adds a bit of extra code to make any window that's using WinUI and `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` _also_ call `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea()` on that window. This does nothing on Windows 11, but on Windows 10, resolves the ""top 1px border is black"" bug, with one caveat.

That caveat is visible in my changes to the Peek module: I changed it from using `AppWindow.TitleBar.ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` to just using the `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` property directly on the `MUX.Window`. This is because, for _some reason_, using the `AppWindow.TitleBar`'s version of the property makes `DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea()` suddenly do nothing. No clue why.
This is not ideal, because it's my understanding that `AppWindow.TitleBar` is The Future(tm), and the old `ExtendsContentIntoTitleBar` is probably going to be deprecated soon. 

Other thoughts:

- `ForceTopBorder1PixelInset()` is kind of a stupid name. Open to suggestions.
- Should we do an OS check inside `ForceTopBorder1PixelInset()` so it's a no-op on W11?

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

Opened each of:
- Settings Window
- OOBE Window
- HOSTS editor window
- Advanced Paste window
- Environment Variables editor window
- File Locksmith window
- Peek window
- Registry Preview window

...on Windows 10 and verified that the top borders all showed correctly.

I also validated (just for the Settings Window and HOSTS editor window) that the appearance on Windows 11 was unchanged.

<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
This PR aims to fix the bug #35225 by introducing a new method `IsJson` to determine if a given text is in JSON format. 
The `IsJson` method is then utilized in the `ToJsonFromXmlOrCsvAsync` method to optimize the processing logic. 
If the text is already in JSON format, it is returned directly without further conversion from XML or CSV.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
Let me explain why we need this change.
1. Currently, we can not enable AOT in a project which are using WPF and WindowsForm. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/trimming/incompatibilities
2. It seems that we don't need to import WPF and WindowsForm in this infra project. So, I removed it and tested. All things seems well.
3. If we want to mark this project is AOT compatible, we need to remove reflection usage.

## Summary of the Pull Request
**Why we need add fuzz test?**
This is a request from the SFI Wave 3, currently set as Priority 1.

**In this PR:**
1. **New Fuzz Tests Project:** Created for AdvancedPaste using .NET 8-Windows. Initial testing will focus on JsonHelper.
      -  **Note**: Since OneFuzz does not yet support .NET 9 code testing, this is a temporary solution. A .NET 8 project is used initially, linking the code through a file.
2. **Linking and Dependency Management:** Connected JsonHelper file to the Fuzz Tests Project, minimizing dependencies by adding a mock Logger.
3. **New Pipeline:** Introduced to onboard OneFuzz.

**Testing Result:**
The new pipeline is being tested using the CI pipeline.

## Summary of the Pull Request
* clean up some AOT build issue
* Refactor Log function. Use System.AppContext to get the application path.
* Log CallerMemberName, File, LineNumber in logger and remove GetCallerInfo.


To drop all reflection usage, we can get about 18% performance improvement by this PR change. Here's a simple test which call Logger.LogError 100k times. (Left: before this change, Right with this change)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54281b43-ec96-4244-bc61-7baf9e41e6d6)

By this change, we can remove the wired useage of reflection which try to get some infromation from stack frame. It's hard to understand and maintain.

About the log format.  I've compared the advancedPaste module's log. Most of them are equal, but some of them are not the same.
Such as:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b93342d-13aa-4544-bb0a-a5b3febd1b62)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ef0e4a5-9ee0-44b5-8ef2-9c4553a1d52f)
The original code will retrieve the caller info from the stack frame. The caller name will be so strange in some case. After this change merged, we will get a more clear information.

36317,Add new pipeline using the latest webview2 from Edge Canary,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
### Changes Introduced

This PR introduces a new parameter `usingLatestWebView2` to control whether the latest WebView2 Canary version is used during testing and CI builds. The specific changes are as follows:

1. job-test-project.yml

- Added `usingLatestWebView2` parameter of type boolean with a default value of false.
- Included a PowerShell script to download and install the latest Microsoft Edge Canary version.
- Added a registry modification script to enable the WebView2 Canary channel.

2. pipeline-ci-build.yml

- Added `usingLatestWebView2` parameter of type boolean with a default value of false.
- Passed the `usingLatestWebView2` parameter in the stages section to use it during CI builds.

### Purpose

The introduction of the `usingLatestWebView2` parameter allows developers to opt-in to using the latest WebView2 Canary version during tests and CI builds. This helps in identifying and resolving issues related to the latest WebView2 version early, thereby improving the project's stability and compatibility.

## Summary

_The [old PR](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/pull/36222) cannot be reopened, so I create a new PR_

This PR introduces the following changes to the CI pipeline and version management:


### Pipeline Enhancements:
- Added a new script `UpdateVersions.ps1` to automate the update of `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK` versions across various project files.
- Introduced a new pipeline configuration `ci-using-the-latest-winappsdk.yml` to build using the latest `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`.
- Updated existing pipeline configurations to support the new `useLatestWinAppSDK` parameter.


### Pipeline Configuration Updates:
- Updated `job-build-project.yml` to handle the `useLatestWinAppSDK` parameter and adjust the `RestoreAdditionalProjectSourcesArg` accordingly.
- Added a new template `steps-update-winappsdk-and-restore-nuget.yml` for updating and restoring NuGet packages with the latest `Microsoft.WindowsAppSDK`.
- Added WinAPPSDK version selection, the pipeline can be manually triggered to use the specified version.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

There's a new accessibility forbidden pattern:

> Do not use `(click) here` links
> For more information, see:
> * https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere
> * https://webaim.org/techniques/hypertext/link_text
> * https://granicus.com/blog/why-click-here-links-are-bad/
> * https://heyoka.medium.com/dont-use-click-here-f32f445d1021
```pl
(?i)(?:>|\[)(?:(?:click |)here|link|(?:read |)more)(?:</|\]\()
```

There are some minor bugs that I'm aware of and which I've fixed since this release, but I don't expect to make another release this month.

I've added a pair of patterns for includes and pragmas. My argument is that the **compiler** will _generally_ tell you if you've misspelled an include and the **linker** will _generally_ tell you if you misspell a lib.

- There's a caveat here: If your include case-insensitively matches the referenced file (but doesn't properly match it), then unless you either use a case-sensitive file system (as opposed to case-preserving) or beg clang to warn, you won't notice when you make this specific mistake -- this matters in that a couple of Windows headers (e.g. Unknwn.h) have particular case and repositories don't tend to consistently/properly write them.

Due to https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/10043 I had to manually load the light and dark theme, and I've copied AnimationFactorToValueConverter.cs, FallbackBrushConverter.cs and FluentHC.xaml from ttps://github.com/dotnet/wpf in order to make HighContrast mode not crash.

Comparison Windows 11. Left side new one, right side old one.

After:

2. update the `NOTICE.md` and `verifyNoticeMdAgainstNugetPackages.ps1` to fix pipeline
**Root Cause:** When a project sets <IsAotCompatible> to true, `Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks` is automatically referenced, and the output includes this package with an (A) designation.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08bd31d2-a32c-4903-9c11-1b50088d1334)

This PR also updates NOTICE.md to include Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks and `verifyNoticeMdAgainstNugetPackages.ps1`  to remove the Auto-referenced (A) description.

## Summary of the Pull Request
This pull request introduces a set of MSBuild props for AOT compatibility validation, which projects can import once they are fully AOT-compatible.

AOT Compatibility Check: The props file enables AOT compatibility checks in projects, ensuring that only AOT-supported code is included. This prevents non-AOT code from being added once AOT support is fully implemented. The props are specifically designed for projects that will eventually support AOT.

No AOT Publish Enabled Yet: Currently, the AOT publish functionality is not enabled. The focus is on performing AOT compatibility checks for now, and the actual AOT publishing will be activated once all required AOT configurations are in place.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This PR corrects the following issues with Peek's UserSettings class:

- A default value was manually set for `CloseAfterLosingFocus` in the constructor. This should be set by instantiating the `PeekProperties` class instead, which should be the single source for settings defaults.
- The exception logging was in the wrong if block, meaning an error was only logged if all 6 failed attempts had been made to load the settings file.
- `retryCount` was misnamed, as it represented the current _attempt_ number, not the number of retries. This made the loop exit check difficult to understand. I'm unsure, but I think the intention was to try the load 5 times, but it ended up being 6 because of this.
- A check was made for whether the settings file exists, and a new settings file created if it was absent. However, this is already handled by `GetSettingsOrDefault`.
- (This is a bit pedantic, I admit.) The filename “settings.json” was hard-coded when setting up the FileSystemWatcher. I’ve made the `SettingsUtils.DefaultFileName` string public and used this instead, guaranteeing they'll always be consistent. It’s very unlikely ""settings.json"" would ever be changed, but you never know...

Updates were also made to the following:

- Added a smaller number of retries with an exponential back-off delay instead of always waiting 500ms between retry attempts. This means temporary file lock issues won’t hold the application up for as long. There are now 4 attempts instead of 6 in the previous code.
- Set the failsafe defaults using `PeekProperties` defaults if the settings file could not be read.
- Moved the lock to only cover the critical section which applies the settings.
- Added warning suppression for `_watcher` declaration. This is required because the `FileSystemWatcher` is set up in another class.
- Simplified flow and separated out some functionality into separate methods.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

The application was tested before and after the change, confirming that:

- A new settings file is still created if one doesn't exist.
- Defaults are used if the file could not be read after all retries have been exhausted or if a non-IOException happened.
- Logging failed attempts is fixed and now correctly happens regardless of the number of attempts made to load the file.",closed,2024-11-27T00:24:35Z,2024-11-28T17:36:33Z,2024-11-28T17:36:33Z,Needs-Review,main,peek-usersettings-load-logging-fix,2,50,46,2,1,1,jaimecbernardo,APPROVED,False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/36111

35952,[Dev] Fixed name of logging method in managed logging,"## Summary of the Pull Request
The name of the logging method is included in logs. Sometimes the name of the method can be:
- Wrong due to method-inlining invalidating assumptions made within logging routines.
- Mangled for Async methods.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

### Issue 1
Apparently due to inlining (no other plausible explanation comes to mind), we sometimes log the incorrect method name:

```
[23:18:41.8536506] [Trace] AsyncMethodBuilderCore::Start
[23:18:52.7273013] [Debug] AsyncStateMachineBox`1::ExecutionContextCallback
```

This has been fixed by marking logging methods with `NoInlining` so we can use a consistent frame index on the call-stack to identify the actual logging method.

### Issue 2
Async methods are logged with a mangled name because of compiler-generated code for the async state-machine:

```
[23:18:04.7979690] [Trace] <ToMarkdownAsync>d__0::MoveNext
[23:18:52.7053439] [Trace] <TryCopyPasteAsync>d__0::MoveNext
```

This has been fixed by detecting this scenario and attempting to correct it by looking up the call-stack.

## Validation Steps Performed
Ran a number of PowerToys modules in Release and Debug and verified method names were logged correctly.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
The function now does an explicit check to see if the calling assembly lies within the WinUI3Apps folder, and if so it navigates to the parent directory before continuing resolution of the assets path.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
I reproduced the failure case by creating an empty `\AppData\Local\PowerToys\WinUI3Apps\Assets\Monaco` folder and then using Peek to preview files supported by Monaco, such as source code files. This confirmed the original report. After applying the fix and retesting, the same Peek previews correctly rendered the files.

I also confirmed that the Explorer Preview Pane was unaffected, and also used Peek to view several non-Monaco files, such as images and PDFs, to confirm that other file types were still rendering without issue.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
There's quite a lot of refactoring and code-quality improvements here. A non-exhaustive list:
- All transformations now work on and produce a 'virtual' in-memory clipboard representation (`DataPackage`) rather than on the system clipboard. The system clipboard is only read once per operation and written to only just before pasting (if needed). There are multiple reasons for this:
    - Prevents Semantic Kernel intermediate transformations from polluting the clipboard with intermediate data.
    - Allows Semantic Kernel tool-calls (and in fact, other transforms too) to easily run on the thread-pool without causing ""calling application is not the owner of the data on the clipboard"" issues.
    - Allows transformations to be unit-tested without manipulating the system clipboard.
    - Cleaner and faster as the actual clipboard is touched only once.
- More `Async` within AdvancedPaste (this was also done as part of Additional Actions but there's much more of it now).
- Paste actions now have a `CanPreview` property (and Image to Text has been marked as having it to allow it to be previewed)
- `lastQuery.json` functionality is removed
- `IFileSystem` is used within Advanced Paste to improve testability.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

When receiving a numpad specific key, check if there is the numpad lock key with the same scan code that is overwriting shift and if it does, we overwrite the original key with the numpad key. I do this because when using for example numpad1 as shift we get the following scenario: 
- Press numpad1 -> we get in the Windows hook event key pressed for numpad1, then send shift
- We get shift pressed, we ignore this event
- We get shift release, we ignore this event
- We get `numpad end button` instead of `numpad1` release since shift was also pressed.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
Replace numpad 1 with shift. Check that when releasing numpad1 shift gets toggled off.

<ul>
<li>🏷️ Test first <em>on a branch</em> by changing your workflow tags/references to this release. See 🐣 Breaking Changes for how to adapt your workflow.</li>
<li>🐛 See Known Issues for known issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>✨ Highlights</h2>
<ul>
<li>SARIF reporting should work for <code>push</code> events and workflows that use <code>checkout: true</code></li>
<li>If you use a second job for commenting and the most recent comment was collapsed in response to a previous commit and the latest commit doesn't trigger a new comment, a new job will be not be dispatched</li>
<li>Files with Mac OS classic line endings (<code>\r</code>) should be properly handled (previously they'd erroneously trigger a <code>minified-file</code> warning)</li>
</ul>
<h2>🐛 Known issues</h2>
<p>Check the list of <a href=""https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aregression+milestone%3Av0.0.25"">regressions with target milestone v0.0.25</a> for more information about issues that should be fixed soon.</p>
<ul>
<li>Running the check-spelling action on Windows runners doesn't work
<ul>
<li>This appears to be an incompatibility involving StrawberryPerl, cpanm, and ExtUtils::Manifest</li>
<li>Note that running check-spelling on a GitHub hosted runner other than ubuntu-* doesn't really
make sense as the Windows and macOS runners are much more expensive per minute and check-spelling
itself doesn't need any facilities from the OS -- it should be checking the spelling of files
as they are present in commits.</li>
<li>While the check-spelling action won't work on Windows, apply.pl and the output check-spelling produces are expected to work on Windows.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>🐣 Breaking Changes</h2>
<h3><a href=""https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Configuration.html#usemagicfile""><code>use_magic_file</code></a> is now enabled by default</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>magic file enables check-spelling to automatically recognize more files to exclude. It has been pretty reliable/helpful.</p>
<h4>Migrating</h4>
<p>When you upgrade, if there are files that magic file detects as worthy of excluding, it will suggest adding them to excludes. If they turn out to be files that shouldn't be excluded, you can add <code>use_magic_file: 0</code> to turn it off (and please file an issue with a sample showing why the files were falsely suggested for exclusion).</p>
<p>If you had previously set <code>use_magic_file: 1</code>, you can remove that setting, as that's now the new default. (You can also leave the value set, it's basically harmless, but it is now superfluous.)</p>
<h3><code>cache-dictionaries</code> has been removed</h3>

## Validation Steps Performed

Run manual tests from [Test Checklist Template](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/5bc7201ae2b75b53d3a4bc35119c867ecf71c5f6/doc/releases/tests-checklist-template.md#mouse-without-borders):

* Install PowerToys on two PCs in the same local network:
   - [x] Verify that PowerToys is properly installed on both PCs.
   
 * Setup Connection:
   - [x] Open MWB's settings on the first PC and click the ""New Key"" button. Verify that a new security key is generated.
   - [x] Copy the generated security key and paste it in the corresponding input field in the settings of MWB on the second PC. Also enter the name of the first PC in the required field.
   - [x] Press ""Connect"" and verify that the machine layout now includes two PC tiles, each displaying their respective PC names.
   
 * Verify Connection Status:
   - [x] Ensure that the border of the remote PC turns green, indicating a successful connection.
   - [x] Enter an incorrect security key and verify that the border of the remote PC turns red, indicating a failed connection.
   
 * Test Remote Mouse/Keyboard Control:
   - [x] With the PCs connected, test the mouse/keyboard control from one PC to another. Verify that the mouse/keyboard inputs are correctly registered on the other PC.
   - [ ] Test remote mouse/keyboard control across all four PCs, if available. Verify that inputs are correctly registered on each connected PC when the mouse is active there.
     - unable to test - only 2 machines available
   
 * Test Remote Control with Elevated Apps:
   - note - the main PowerToys.exe must be running as a **non**-admin for these tests
   - [x] Open an elevated app on one of the PCs. Verify that without ""Use Service"" enabled, PowerToys does not control the elevated app.
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings (need to run PowerToys.exe as admin to enable ""Use Service"", then restart PowerToys.exe as non-admin). Verify that PowerToys can now control the elevated app remotely. Verify that MWB processes are running as LocalSystem, while the MWB helper process is running non-elevated.
   - [x] Toggle ""Use Service"" again, verify that each time you do that, the MWB processes are restarted.
   - [x] Run PowerToys elevated on one of the machines, verify that you can control elevated apps remotely now on that machine.

* Test Module Enable Status:
   - [ ] For all combinations of ""Use Service""/""Run PowerToys as admin"", try enabling/disabling MWB module and verify that it's indeed being toggled using task manager.
   
 * Test Disconnection/Reconnection:
   - [x] Disconnect one of the PCs from network. Verify that the machine layout updates to reflect the disconnection. 
   - [x] Do the same, but now by exiting PowerToys.
   - [x] Start PowerToys again, verify that the PCs are reconnected.
  
 * Test Various Local Network Conditions:
   - [ ] Test MWB performance under various network conditions (e.g., low bandwidth, high latency). Verify that the tool maintains a stable connection and functions correctly.

 * Clipboard Sharing:
   - [x] Copy some text on one PC and verify that the same text can be pasted on another PC.
   - [x] Use the screenshot key and Win+Shift+S to take a screenshot on one PC and verify that the screenshot can be pasted on another PC.
   - [x] Copy a file in Windows Explorer and verify that the file can be pasted on another PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [x] Try to copy multiple files and directories and verify that it's not possible (only the first selected file is being copied).
 
 * Drag and Drop:
   - [ ] Drag a file from Windows Explorer on one PC, cross the screen border onto another PC, and release it there. Verify that the file is copied to the other PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] While dragging the file, verify that a corresponding icon is displayed under the mouse cursor.
   - [ ] Without moving the mouse from one PC to the target PC, press CTRL+ALT+F1/2/3/4 hotkey to switch to the target PC directly and verify that file sharing/dropping is not working.

 * Lock and Unlock with ""Use Service"" Enabled:
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings.
   - [x] Lock a remote PC using Win+L, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can unlock the remote PC.
   - [x] Disable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings, lock the remote PC, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can't unlock the remote PC.

 * Test Settings:
   - [ ] Change the rest of available settings on MWB page and verify that each setting works as described.

35711,[ci][Arm64]Manually copy WebView2 core dll after building and publishing,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request

After we've upgraded Windows App SDK to 1.6, Dev Files Preview on Peek has been broken on ARM64.
For .86, we've added WebView2 to Registry Preview in order to have Monaco Editor as the text editor, which is also broken on ARM64.
After a lengthy investigation, it seems we've found the core issue, PowerToys has been shipping with a x64 Microsoft.Web.WebView2.Core.dll in the ARM64 installer, which fails at runtime.
We seem to have hit a version of https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/issues/4826

When we build PowerToys in Dart for release, we publish some of the C# WinUI3Apps after building PowerToys and before signing / building the install. This means that the WindowsAppSDK build will recopy its WebView2 dependency, which for some reason is ARM64. On local builds of PowerToys, PowerRename, a C++ WinAppSDK application finished last, which copies the right dll and it's the reason we weren't being able to repro the issue on local builds of ARM64 PowerToys.

This PR solves the issue by including a short time hack in the CI to copy the right dll after publishing the C# WinUI3Apps when building for ARM64.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
Waiting for 4 concurrent builds of ARM64 from Dart to test whether the problem is solved.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

- Removed System.IO.Abstraction from ManagedCommon.
  Reduce dependency/complexity a little bit: Common Logger and Language Helper aren't tested and the file system abstraction isn't really needed.
- Aligned the code to new API signature
- Changed expected files and folders for some PT Run Folder plugin tests.
  Asserts were wrong even using previous package version. It seems that the mocked file system is acting differently while enumerating files and folders. Think we shouldn't remove these tests in case it will be fixed in future releases.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
* Removes `srt` from `txtExt` and registers it as a new language
* Changes `customTokenColors` to `customTokenThemeRules`
* Adds custom Monarch definition
  * Block numbers tokenized as `number`
  * Timestamp tokenized as `identifier.type`
  * Subtitle content tokenized as `string`
  * Format tags (`<b>`, `<i>`...) tokenized as `tag`
  * Only timestamps in the `HH:mm:ss,mmm` format are considered valid, even though something like `00:123:01,1234 -->  00:00:02,000` is technically valid and would get interpreted as `02:03:02,234 --> 1193:02:49,296` (I have no idea what's going on)
  * I couldn't find any official description of the srt format, so I used ffmpeg to determine what is considered valid

<blockquote>
<h2>Release 0.0.23</h2>
<h2>⏩ Upgrading</h2>
<ul>
<li>🏷️ Test first <em>on a branch</em> by changing your workflow tags/references to this release. See 🐣 Breaking Changes for how to adapt your workflow.</li>
<li>🐛 See Known Issues for known issues</li>
</ul>
<h2>🐣 Breaking Changes</h2>
<h3><a href=""https://docs.check-spelling.dev/Configuration.html#usemagicfile""><code>use_magic_file</code></a> is now enabled by default</h3>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>magic file enables check-spelling to automatically recognize more files to exclude. It has been pretty reliable/helpful.</p>
<h4>Migrating</h4>
<p>When you upgrade, if there are files that magic file detects as worthy of excluding, it will suggest adding them to excludes. If they turn out to be files that shouldn't be excluded, you can add <code>use_magic_file: 0</code> to turn it off (and please file an issue with a sample showing why the files were falsely suggested for exclusion).</p>
<p>If you had previously set <code>use_magic_file: 1</code>, you can remove that setting, as that's now the new default. (You can also leave the value set, it's basically harmless, but it is now superfluous.)</p>
<h3><code>cache-dictionaries</code> has been removed</h3>
<p>... along with all other caching -- check-spelling should be faster now than in previous versions, so the lack of this caching shouldn't be a concern.</p>
<h4>Migrating</h4>
<p>If you're using this setting, just remove it (you'll get a warning from GitHub when the workflow runs).</p>
<h3>check-spelling now requires <code>actions/upload-artifact@v4</code> / <code>actions/checkout@v4</code></h3>
<p>It is quite possible that GHES does not support these yet.</p>
<h4>Migrating</h4>
<p>Users of GHES instances that don't have access to those actions should not upgrade until they're available.</p>
<h3>Comment block before forbidden-patterns is now shown when patterns are tripped</h3>
<p>When a forbidden-pattern matches content, lines immediately preceding it that start with <code># </code> will be shown in the GitHub Step Summary.</p>
<h4>Migrating</h4>
<p>You should change such comments to start with <code># </code> (a single <code>#</code> that isn't followed by a space is assumed to be a commented out pattern). And you should ensure that comments are easy for readers to understand.</p>
<p>For example, in <a href=""https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this"">spell-check-this</a>, lines that used to say <code># s.b. ...</code> have been <a href=""https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/commit/b3fd57a3b666641b1adc8660fe0b6b8f4182104e"">changed</a> to <code># Should be ...</code></p>
<p>See 💬 <a href=""https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/wiki/Feature%3A-Report-associated-comment-for-forbidden-patterns"">Report associated comment for forbidden patterns</a></p>

35622,[Peek] Expand image format support for Image Previewer,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
This removes the hardcoded list of file extensions from Peek's Image Previewer code, and instead relies upon the list returned from `BitmapDecoder` directly, which represents the formats the end user's system is capable of decoding.

<!-- Please review the items on the PR checklist before submitting-->

<!-- Provide a more detailed description of the PR, other things fixed or any additional comments/features here -->
## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
The use of `GetDecoderInformationEnumerator()` to get all WIC-supported formats:

- Automatically picks up new codec support if installed on a user's system
- Is more accurate, directly reflecting what the system can handle
- Future-proofs the code against new image formats, i.e. we don't have to add to the list of supported extensions if Windows adds more (like HEIC etc.)


<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed
This was tested manually with a test folder of images in a variety of different formats, from popular filetypes like JPEG and GIF, to AVIF, cursor files, JPEGXL, and several example RAW files. I also tested with other non-image files, such as PDF, text file, MP3 and videos, to ensure the other previewers were unaffected.

Note: I don't have an example file for every supported image format.

## Additions and Removals
On my Windows 11 machine, this PR adds Peek support for the following types:

```
.rle
.icon
.cur
.exif
.dng
.dds
.avci
.heics
.heifs
.avcs
.avifs
.PTX
.PXN
.DNG
.JXL
```

These were previously in the hardcoded list, but are not marked as compatible on my machine:

```
.jfi
.jif
.thumb
.r3d
.rwz
```

These may have been present on the original developer's machine when the list was curated. They should be picked up with this new code if a WIC decoder exists on the target machine for them.

## Examples

**Cursor**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8f47f5a-d0e8-4d2c-a143-2f8630feaaf8)


**JPEGXL** (after adding system support via [JXL WinThumb](https://github.com/saschanaz/jxl-winthumb)):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ce9a75-c35b-4e9a-ae13-466b105b5254)

(Example JPEGXL images can be created by converting existing image files with https://squoosh.app/)


**DNG** (drone footage still):
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc84cb2-c4bb-4b50-9875-52f898e3060c)


## Important Note
HEIC and JPEGXL are marked in Windows as compatible, but require separate installation. For HEIC this means paying a licence, as it is patent-encumbered. For JPEGXL, Windows support is not yet built-in, but can be added via a third party extension. If the user does not have a WIC-compatible codec installed, there will be no change from the previous version of Peek, i.e. the UnsupportedFilePreviewer will be used to show overview information of the file:

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
The current list of "".png"", "".jpg"", "".jpeg"", "".gif"", "".bmp"", "".tiff"", "".ico"", "".svg"" is incomplete. This PR obtains a list of all supported extensions from the BitmapDecoder itself. The full list on my Windows 11 machine is:

```
.bmp
.dib
.rle
.gif
.ico
.icon
.cur
.jpeg
.jpe
.jpg
.jfif
.exif
.png
.tiff
.tif
.dng
.wdp
.jxr
.dds
.heic
.heif
.hif
.avci
.heics
.heifs
.avcs
.avif
.avifs
.webp
.3FR
.ARI
.ARW
.BAY
.CAP
.CR2
.CR3
.CRW
.DCS
.DCR
.DRF
.EIP
.ERF
.FFF
.IIQ
.K25
.KDC
.MEF
.MOS
.MRW
.NEF
.NRW
.ORF
.ORI
.PEF
.PTX
.PXN
.RAF
.RAW
.RW2
.RWL
.SR2
.SRF
.SRW
.X3F
.DNG
.JXL
```

This includes several RAW camera formats and some variations for types already marked as supported but not included in the hardcoded list (including "".jfif"" and "".jpe"" for JPEG files, for example).

Note: BitmapDecoder on my machine does not include a reference to SVG files, although this was explicitly included in the previous hardcoded list. I tested the existing code with several SVG files, and it resulted in an error for me, so I have not added it back in:

![Screenshot 2024-10-25 222545](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2004ceb-acc2-4a34-a1d3-bf082f1b3bb4)

I assume that if SVG is added as a WIC codec, that it will be transparently supported in Image to Text via the new enumeration method.

3. Break out mouse utilities <- phase 2
4. introduce top level - right pane navigation <- phase 2 or 3?
5. Badging <- phase 2 or 3?
   1. introduce 'new' badging
   2. introduce 'deprecated' badging
   3. introduce Build into Windows now badging

Search, pinning will be next 'large' phase.

## Summary of the Pull Request

This is the last part of the Mouse Jump styles work that finally enables the feature in Settings UI and in the Mouse Jump preview image.

See https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/27511 for the original feature suggestion.

### Changes in this PR

* Moved the Mouse Jump ""settings ui"" xaml and code into a separate ""MouseJumpPanel.xaml"" control to make it easier to make changes to the settings controls
* Added a new ""Appearance"" expander in Mouse Jump settings with all the new border, colour, 3d effect, spacing, etc settings controls to allow the user to set custom properties
* Also added some predefined style options:
  * ""Compact"" is the original Mouse Jump style with just a borders around the whole image and no other chrome
  * ""Bezelled"" is the new default with some simple spacing between screens and 3d bezels drawn around them

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81039ae2-3391-43a7-84fb-9457d7409721)

### Reviewer Notes

* Added a reference to CommunityToolkit.WinUI.Controls.Segmented in PowerToys.Settings to allow the ""Compact | Bezelled | Custom"" options for Preview Style

* Added a reference to MouseJump.Common in PowerToys.Settings to allow rendering the preview image when settings are changed

* I've made ""Bezelled"" the new default style as a precursor to the proposed Mouse Without Borders integration in #34126 - it'll be easier to make the bezel colours vary by host if they're already visible.

* Code touches the internals of the Segmented control to force the preview image to be centered - see ```PreviewImage_Loaded``` method - might be brittle if the implementation changes?

* Config upgrade seems a bit odd - the in-memory settings get upgraded fine with ```""version"": ""1.`""``` but it seems to get reverted and saved again as ```""version"": ""1.0""``` and then overwritten again as ```""version"""": ""1.1""```. I've worked around this by additionally checking if the new settings have values before upgrading, but it seems like that's what the version flag is supposed to be for. It *works* for now anyway, but not sure if this is the right way to do it...

* Does the ""Copy to Custom preview style"" need an ""Are you sure? Yes / No"" before overwriting and / or a ""Copied!"" message after copying? I'm happy to leave it as is, but feedback welcome...

35520,[ci]Fail when a step in multiline powershell fails,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
After the recent pipelines refactor, I've noticed that our script to check if every binary is signed was not failing the build.
This is because on multi-line scripts, powershell only fails if the last line returns non-0, ignoring return values of previous lines.
To account for this I've made the following changes:
- Split Verify XAML and Nuget verification steps into individual steps again.
- Changed verifyArm64Configuration.ps1 and versionAndSignCheck.ps1 to use stderr to output errors, since that will cause powershell step to fail by default.

I've added some commits to cause failures on purpose which I'll revert before converting the PR into a final one for review.",closed,2024-10-21T15:40:55Z,2024-10-23T07:52:48Z,2024-10-23T07:52:48Z,Good to Merge,main,dev/jaime/fix-ci-not-failing-on-unsigned,3,10,2,8,0,0,"stefansjfw, DHowett, crutkas","APPROVED, APPROVED, APPROVED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/35520

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
There are several new and changed elements in this PR:

- Navigation has been updated to track forward and backward movement through files. This is necessary so deleting a file always shows the next item in the natural sequence, i.e. the previous item if the user was moving backwards. This replicates Windows Photo and other media viewers.
- The indexes of deleted items are recorded rather than altering the `Items` collection (which could be very large). There are now `DisplayIndex` and `DisplayItemCount` properties, which reflect the calculated position and total. The old `CurrentIndex` still points to the actual index of the current item in the collection, but this is now internal only.
- The MainWindow ViewModel includes quite a bit of navigation-related code. We may wish to split this out into a separate model or provider in the future.
- When previewing a selection of items (where the number and total are shown in the title bar), these counts will always be shown. Previously, this info would not show if the count was 1. (This was likely because opening Peek while a single item is selected expands the Items collection to cover the entire folder and turns off the ""(position/total)"" display.)
- A text message has been added for when there are no more files remaining, i.e. the user has deleted the last one from their selection (or from the current folder if Peek wasn't opened via multi-selection). It may be worthwhile to add a simple icon by the side here - perhaps an image placeholder graphic? - but I've gone with the simple approach for now.
- Changes were made to the title bar code to ensure that the last filename and ""open in application"" details were not shown when there are no more files to preview. This was because there was an (entirely reasonable!) assumption in the code that there would always be one or more files being previewed.
- The delete operation sends the item to the Recycle Bin only. It was considered whether pressing `Shift + Delete` could do a permanent delete, and this is certainly possible in the future, but this release errs on the side of caution, especially as it's a new feature and involves deleting things.
- The Delete function itself relies upon a shell file operation, reflecting the fact that we're previewing shell items. This required adding some code to `NativeMethods.cs` for the API call, struct, flags, and error messages.
- Only *file* deletion is allowed. I considered allowing for empty folder deletes, too, but, again, this first release is deliberately conservative.
- Updated Peek documentation.

## Validation Steps Performed

(Manual tests only.)

Tested:
- Single and multi-selection methods of opening Peek.
- Deleting from beginning, end and middle of a sequence (after opening Peek via multi-selection).
- Deleting until no files remained.
- Previewing a folder containing a mix of files and folders.
- Previewing a folder containing a mix of files which can be previewed and unsupported file types.
- Attempting to delete folders via Peek.
- Deleting a file in the selected list via Explorer before it could be previewed.
- Deleting a file from an external USB drive which doesn't support the Recycle Bin, to confirm that the system confirmation dialog is displayed which warns against permanent file deletion.
- Cancelling a permanent delete, confirming the file is re-added to the current list.
- Changing the ""Don't show this warning again"" setting in the delete confirmation dialog updates the settings.
- Updating the ""Ask for confirmation before deleting files"" setting in the Settings app is reflected in Peek immediately, and vice-versa. (The Settings app requires navigating to another page then returning to the Peek settings.)",open,2024-10-13T21:10:20Z,,,Needs-Review,main,peek-delete,19,697,63,14,25,1,"htcfreek, daverayment, daverayment, daverayment, htcfreek, htcfreek, daverayment, htcfreek, htcfreek, daverayment, daverayment, jaimecbernardo","CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, CHANGES_REQUESTED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/35418

## Validation Steps Performed

Run manual tests from [Test Checklist Template](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/5bc7201ae2b75b53d3a4bc35119c867ecf71c5f6/doc/releases/tests-checklist-template.md#mouse-without-borders):

* Install PowerToys on two PCs in the same local network:
   - [x] Verify that PowerToys is properly installed on both PCs.
   
 * Setup Connection:
   - [x] Open MWB's settings on the first PC and click the ""New Key"" button. Verify that a new security key is generated.
   - [x] Copy the generated security key and paste it in the corresponding input field in the settings of MWB on the second PC. Also enter the name of the first PC in the required field.
   - [x] Press ""Connect"" and verify that the machine layout now includes two PC tiles, each displaying their respective PC names.
   
 * Verify Connection Status:
   - [x] Ensure that the border of the remote PC turns green, indicating a successful connection.
   - [x] Enter an incorrect security key and verify that the border of the remote PC turns red, indicating a failed connection.
   
 * Test Remote Mouse/Keyboard Control:
   - [x] With the PCs connected, test the mouse/keyboard control from one PC to another. Verify that the mouse/keyboard inputs are correctly registered on the other PC.
   - [ ] Test remote mouse/keyboard control across all four PCs, if available. Verify that inputs are correctly registered on each connected PC when the mouse is active there.
     - unable to test - only 2 machines available
   
 * Test Remote Control with Elevated Apps:
   - [x] Open an elevated app on one of the PCs. Verify that without ""Use Service"" enabled, PowerToys does not control the elevated app.
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings. Verify that PowerToys can now control the elevated app remotely. Verify that MWB processes are running as LocalSystem, while the MWB helper process is running non-elevated.
   - [x] Toggle ""Use Service"" again, verify that each time you do that, the MWB processes are restarted.
   - [x] Run PowerToys elevated on one of the machines, verify that you can control elevated apps remotely now on that machine.

* Test Module Enable Status:
   - [x] For all combinations of ""Use Service""/""Run PowerToys as admin"", try enabling/disabling MWB module and verify that it's indeed being toggled using task manager.
   
 * Test Disconnection/Reconnection:
   - [x] Disconnect one of the PCs from network. Verify that the machine layout updates to reflect the disconnection. 
   - [x] Do the same, but now by exiting PowerToys.
   - [x] Start PowerToys again, verify that the PCs are reconnected.
  
 * Test Various Local Network Conditions:
   - [ ] Test MWB performance under various network conditions (e.g., low bandwidth, high latency). Verify that the tool maintains a stable connection and functions correctly.

 * Clipboard Sharing:
   - [x] Copy some text on one PC and verify that the same text can be pasted on another PC.
   - [x] Use the screenshot key and Win+Shift+S to take a screenshot on one PC and verify that the screenshot can be pasted on another PC.
   - [ ] Copy a file in Windows Explorer and verify that the file can be pasted on another PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] Try to copy multiple files and directories and verify that it's not possible (only the first selected file is being copied).
 
 * Drag and Drop:
   - [ ] Drag a file from Windows Explorer on one PC, cross the screen border onto another PC, and release it there. Verify that the file is copied to the other PC. Make sure the file size is below 100MB.
   - [ ] While dragging the file, verify that a corresponding icon is displayed under the mouse cursor.
   - [ ] Without moving the mouse from one PC to the target PC, press CTRL+ALT+F1/2/3/4 hotkey to switch to the target PC directly and verify that file sharing/dropping is not working.

 * Lock and Unlock with ""Use Service"" Enabled:
   - [x] Enable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings.
   - [x] Lock a remote PC using Win+L, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can unlock the remote PC.
   - [x] Disable ""Use Service"" in MWB's settings, lock the remote PC, move the mouse to it remotely, and try to unlock it. Verify that you can't unlock the remote PC.

 * Test Settings:
   - [ ] Change the rest of available settings on MWB page and verify that each setting works as described.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
The old folder size calculation was flawed because it used a `DispatcherTimer`'s `Tick` method to update the UI, which meant an initial delay of up to 500ms when a large folder was being enumerated. This is fixed in this patch by immediately reporting the state when starting the folder size calculation.

In addition, the folder enumeration code has been rewritten and simplified. It now avoids the recursive code of the original, using the more modern `DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles` method to recursively search all files in a single call. This is significantly faster than the original approach (see below).

UI updates are also far more frequent in this rewrite, giving users much better feedback that the enumeration of a large folder is still progressing, a marked difference to the half-second updates of the old code. A limit of 15 FPS is currently in place, but this may easily be tweaked, if required. `System.Progress` is used for folder size updates, which is simpler and more concise than the replaced code.

The class is now fully managed, and the `Dispose` method has been removed. Background Task setup and usage has been simplified, while care has been made to ensure any viewmodel updates happen on the UI thread.

I have also removed the update to set the `State` to `Loading`, as this could delay updates to the UI while waiting for initial background tasks to complete. Having information render when it is available gives a more responsive view, and reduces flickering somewhat where the loading spinner is displayed for a split second.

### Performance Example
This shows the folder enumeration speed on my laptop for the PowerToys dev folder, which is approximately 108 GB (!) and contains ~292,000 files across 16,301 folders.

## Validation Steps Performed
This update has been validated on files and folders containing a varied mix of file counts and depths. I tested on a laptop's internal SSD, an external 2.5"" HDD connected to the laptop, and a 3.5"" HDD in a desktop PC. Both machines were mid-range several years ago.

I performed before and after tests by navigating a number of example folders, which contained a mix of media files (primarily JPEG images but also movies), documents, ebooks and various sizes of subfolders. I also tested by navigating through my dev folders, which vary significantly in size and depth.

I measured performance simply by using a Stopwatch instance around the call to calculate the folder size, averaging multiple examples of both cold and warm folder enumerations.",closed,2024-09-25T23:53:52Z,2024-10-18T13:52:47Z,2024-10-18T13:52:47Z,Good to Merge,main,peek-unsupportedpreviewer-calcfoldersize-fix,1,81,147,9,9,4,"davidegiacometti, daverayment, daverayment, daverayment, daverayment, davidegiacometti, davidegiacometti, daverayment, davidegiacometti, jaimecbernardo","CHANGES_REQUESTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, APPROVED, APPROVED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/35076

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments
This is the current implementation:
* **Title** (what shows up in Run):
  * Use `G14` - rounds to 14 sig figs and shows scientific notation above 14 digits
  * Show an ellipses when decimal places are cut off
  * Issue #​1: If the result has exactly 14 digits in the integer part (e.g. 12345678901234.1) it will display `12345678901234...`. I'm not sure what the right behavior here should be. On one hand, `.1` was cut off, but on the other, adding ... to the end of an integer seems weird.
  * Issue #​2: `G` rounds the number up, so for example 1.234567 would display as 1.23457..., which is technically incorrect. I guess this isn't a difficult issue to solve, I just don't think it's worth the effort/computation time.
* **Copy:**
Format with `R` - uses scientific above e+17 and cuts off the decimal part at the `double` limit. (This causes some inaccuracy with very large/small numbers, not sure what I can do about that)

34991,[Peek] Fix PreviewHandler previewer not visible on first activation,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request

Issue is 100% reproducible on latest stable PT release: when the first previewed file uses the PreviewHandler (e.g. Office) the preview doesn't work, requiring a window resize or a second activation to be displayed.

This happen because for some weird reason the `EffectiveViewportChanged` event is fired before the loading of the user control: at that point the `containerHwnd` isn't created yet.

34984,Rewrite the entire Azure DevOps build system,"This pull request rewrites the entire Azure DevOps build system.

The guiding principles behind this rewrite are:

- No pipeline definitions should contain steps (or tasks) directly.
- All jobs should be in template files.
- Any set of steps that is reused across multiple jobs must be in
  template files.
- All artifact names can be customized (via a property called
  `artifactStem` on all templates that produce or consume artifacts).
- No compilation happens outside of the ""Build"" phase, to consolidate
  the production and indexing of PDBs.
- All step and job templates are named with `step` or `job` _first_,
  which disambiguates them in the templates directory.
- Most jobs can be run on different `pool`s, so that we can put
  expensive jobs on expensive build agents and cheap jobs on cheap
  build agents. Some jobs handle pool selection on their own, however.

Our original build pipelines used the `VSBuild` task _all over the
place._ This resulted in PowerToys being built in myriad ways, different
for every pipeline. There was an attempt at standardization early on,
where `ci.yml` consumed jobs and steps templates... but when
`release.yml` was added, all of that went out the window.

It's the same story as Terminal (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/pull/15808).

The new pipelines are consistent and focus on a small, well-defined set
of jobs:

- `job-build-project`
    - This is the big one!
    - Takes a list of build configurations and platforms.
    - Produces an artifact named `build-PLATFORM-CONFIG` for the entire
      matrix of possibilities.
    - Builds all of the installers.
    - Optionally signs the output (all of the output).
    - Admittedly has a lot going on.
- `job-test-project`
    - Takes **one** build config and **one** platform.
    - Consumes `build-PLATFORM-CONFIG`
    - Selects its own pools (hardcoded) because it knows about
      architectures and must choose the right agent arch.
    - Runs tests (directly on the build agent).
- `job-publish-symbols-using-symbolrequestprod-api`
    - Consumes `**/*.pdb` from all prior build phases.
    - Uploads all PDBs in one artifact to Azure DevOps
    - Uses Microsoft's internal symbol publication REST API to submit
      stripped symbols to MSDL for public consumption.

Finally, this pull request has some additional benefits:

- Symbols are published to the private and public feeds at the same
  time, in the same step. They should be available in the public symbol
  server for public folks to debug against!
- We have all the underpinnings necessary to run tests on ARM64 build
  agents.
    - Right now, `ScreenResolutionUtility` is broken
    - I had to introduce a custom version of `UseDotNet` which would
      install the right architecture (🤦); see https://github.com/microsoft/azure-pipelines-tasks/issues/20300.
- All dotnet and nuget versioning is consolidated into a small set of
  step templates.
- This will provide a great place for us to handle versioning changes
  later, since all versioning happens in one place.",closed,2024-09-20T22:49:07Z,2024-09-25T16:23:58Z,2024-09-25T16:23:58Z,Needs-Review,main,dev/duhowett/new-build-rules,25,1268,1261,30,16,2,"github-advanced-security[bot], DHowett, DHowett, github-advanced-security[bot], github-advanced-security[bot], github-advanced-security[bot], github-advanced-security[bot], jaimecbernardo, ethanfangg, johnterickson","COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, COMMENTED, APPROVED, APPROVED, COMMENTED",False,https://api.github.com/repos/microsoft/PowerToys/issues/34984

## Summary of the Pull Request

The WorkspacesLauncher is divided into two parts: WorkspacesLauncher and WorkspacesWindowArranger. This division allows us to run WorkspacesWindowArranger with elevated permissions to reposition elevated windows.
If there is an admin app in the workspace, the arranger will be started with elevated permissions, triggering a UAC dialog.

## Detailed Description of the Pull Request / Additional comments

This uses Monaco to preview plaintext files even if they are not contained within the Monaco supported languages JSON file.

.ahk, .csv, and .tsv extensions have been added for now. Others may be added (possibly by end-users) by editing the new 'Assets\Monaco\monacoExtraExtensions.txt' file.

A small additional fix was made to MonacoHelper.cs by placing a `using` for the JsonDocument instantiation there, as it was not Disposed properly previously.

Care has been taken to not override any Shell preview handlers which could render these new file types. (This was necessary because `ShellPreviewHandlerPreviewer` is later than `WebBrowserPreviewer` in the `IsItemSupported()` checks in PreviewerFactory.cs)

It may be worthwhile enhancing this in the future. For example, by:

- Allowing end users to edit the list of plaintext file extensions via Settings; or
- Using file introspection to determine whether a file is plaintext, instead of rejecting it because its extension is unknown and then opening the generic unsupported file previewer.

<!-- Describe how you validated the behavior. Add automated tests wherever possible, but list manual validation steps taken as well -->
## Validation Steps Performed

- I used the current version of PowerToys to attempt to open .ahk, .csv and .tsv files on my machine, which does not have Microsoft Office installed (so no preview handler for .csv files). I confirmed that the contents were not rendered and the UnsupportedFilePreview was used to show summary information only.
- I confirmed each of the file types could be opened as plaintext with the updated build.
- I ran through my test folder, which contains a mix of image files, documents, text files and so on, confirming there were no issues created for other file types.

Please note: I don't own Microsoft Office / Office 365, so could not confirm that the Excel previewer handler for CSV files still works correctly with this update. Could this please be tested by one of the devs with that software installed?

34802,[Workspaces] add check on project id when launching from editor,"<!-- Enter a brief description/summary of your PR here. What does it fix/what does it change/how was it tested (even manually, if necessary)? -->
## Summary of the Pull Request
check project id when launching from editor. In edge case the temporal json file might contain a different workspace
For better explanaition: the temporal json file exists during the user edits a workspace. In normal cases, when he or she saves or  cancels the edit process, the file gets deleted. But there might be unexpected cases like the workspaces process gets killed from the Task Manager or there is a power supply failure because of a tsunami, earthquake or heavy rain. 
The in the first round implemented logic that the project, which the user wants to launch can be found either in the ""normal"" workspaces.json (there we check the ID) tipically when launching a saved workspace or in the temporal workspaces.json tipically when launching the currently edited workspace, in the above mentioned edge cases leads to launch of a non-expected workspace. To avoid that, the project search process has to be extended with the check of the project id also for the temporal json file.

1631,closed,Switch the package version loading order of package.json/composer.json,2655937429,niklasschaeffer,2025-02-13T08:59:18Z,"Well Just now i stumble upon this issue when i was searching why my package.json version number would not show up at all in starship. Now that im reading this conversion im very surprised. In my eyes it literally makes zero sense to hide a version because it has been defined as private for the npm registry. Like why would you do that ? I want as much information out of my console as possible and this is just very hindering. Also i don't see sense in the argumentation. 

1. JS Projects: Never seen a JS project with a composer.json file in the root (There might be some edge cases I might not be aware of);

- Wrong! I know of a lot of projects which have a composer.json as well.

2. PHP Projects: Many of the most prominent PHP frameworks ([Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel)/[Symfony](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)), but also packages that provides a Web UI, have a package.json file in their root to handle assets bundling.

- Yes! That is true.

3. So the point here is that while the first case is unlikely in the second one you'd probably be more interested in the PHP package version that the one of the JS bundler (which, by the way, is usually set to private).

- WRONG! It does not mean you are not interested in the Js Version. Im a Frontend-Developer working in PHP Focused Project. 

Please revert this offending and by the way very stupid line of code.

Looks like Starship fixed this on their side by flipping the whoami functions called.

If whoami does fix the bug on their side, then you would have to revisit this and revert this change."

It feels quite weird to me that node 22 works fine when executing ES decorators but node 23 breaks because \"they are stage 3 feature\". Things work fine with `--no-experimental-strip-types`. I will try to provide a minimal repro and open a new issue, since its about executing JS so probably not so much of a wontfix material like this one. The repro we have now is basically using https://github.com/mikro-orm/guide and running `npm i && npm run build && npm run start:prod`. This compiles the ESM app via `tsc` and runs it via `node`."

Thats why I asked for some kind of `json` or similar, that is easy parsable by for example github actions. "

Or arm64 with x64 emulation.\n\nNow, regarding package managers, such as yum, dnf, apt, we dont have control over these nor we're able to know which versions they provide and for which architectures."

Hence the intermediate certificate use case is left as a TODO. I think that can be done in a follow-up PR instead, similar to the distrust store.\r\n\r\n> What tools specifically do you mean aren't supporting it?\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, every Rust tool using the rustls-native-certs crate (which seems rather popular) would not work with intermediate certificates, because they only query the root certificates from the current user https://github.com/rustls/rustls-native-certs/blob/main/src/windows.rs (if this approach somehow works for the intermediate certificates, then this PR should also just work because this PR does even more than that, though I doubt it does)."

It's not clear to me why this should be an option in the API at all.\r\n\r\nFor example, as far as I know, the Node stream APIs in `fs` only deal in bytes (unless you use `encoding` to get strings; but this is done with something like `TextDecoderStream` in web streams)."

In v20, the default value is now `true`.\r\n\r\nIf you want to run your code in Node.js v20 and maintain the previous behavior, you can use the `--no-network-family-autoselection` flag when starting Node.js. This will disable the automatic selection of the network family and might help address the issue you\u2019re encountering."

        "Comment Body": "I\u2019ve taken a closer look at this issue and would like to share my observations. From my investigation, it appears that  `Net.Socket` uses a non-overlapped pipe and relies on the [PeekNamedPipe](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/746b17e1a5a9d09294b4c993a0319be6e5c39837/deps/uv/src/win/pipe.c#L1981) API to check the pipe for readable data. Unfortunately, this API call seems to be the cause of the high CPU usage observed.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I noticed in the documentation for the `Net` module, under the section titled [IPC support](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#ipc-support), the following is mentioned:\r\n\r\n> The path must refer to an entry in \\\\?\\pipe\\ or \\\\.\\pipe\\\r\n\r\nThis indicates that using an IP address is not supported by this module, which might limit certain use cases.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, you might consider using [createReadStream](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fscreatereadstreampath-options). Here\u2019s an example of how this can be implemented:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar pipe = fs.createReadStream(null, {\r\n   fd\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis alternative worked as expected on my local computer."

Other browsers, as well as `Deno`, return the same.\n\nHow can I debug/fix this?"

The provided link is for Promises API.\n\nIf you do it like\n\n```js\nconst readline = require('node:readline/promises');\nconst { stdin: input, stdout: output } = require('node:process');\n\nconst rl = readline.createInterface({ input, output });\n\n(async function () {\n  const answer = await rl.question('What is your favorite food? ');\n  console.log(`Oh, so your favorite food is ${answer}`);\n})();\n```\n\nIt works"

You can't use that as an excuse when you're the ones that put it in maintenance mode to begin with. You could have been developing it this whole time. All you're saying is you're doing now what you wanted to do two years ago but received pushback on, so you're trying again.

>has low usage

So what? Many tools in the suite have niche uses only a small portion of users will ever need or want.

Isn't that the point of all of this? To provide specialized tools for enthusiasts based on how useful they can be, rather than how popular they are.

>and there are similar features already available in Windows

In Windows 11. Windows 10 still has 300 days of support left and a significant userbase.

Also, that doesn't seem to matter for things like fancyzones.

Moreover, to keep making this excuse feels dismissive and disrespectful, because you already know its bull. You know because it has been reiterated over and over and over again for two years that *the features are not equivalent*.

This is basically the same as saying ""we're dropping Advanced Paste because Windows has paste function already"". The point is the tool *is better* than the Windows implementation.

If you're going to drop it, don't blow smoke. Drop it with an actual explanation for why the team doesn't want to maintain it anymore. What's the actual difficulty in just leaving it be? What are the issues with maintaining it further?"

I don't think that's the case, at least not for me. I'm on v0.87 as well and VCM works just fine, muting both my microphone and my camera.

As far as I know, there is no current alternative for reliably muting *all* microphones plus the camera on OS level.

This comment I posted earlier turned out to be a red herring. It seems to me that whenever I start an application that uses my mic (that can also be the ""Sounds"" settings window where you see the mic on the ""Recording"" tab), VCM doesn't mute it, only after toggling mic mute on and off. ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"" prevails as always. :D
Closing and starting PowerToys again after starting the application that uses mic also works.

> Does anyone know of a way to just compile and install the VCM component as a standalone executable? Even without the settings page?

I briefly looked into factoring out VCM into a separate application and so far it seems possible. I haven't got far in the process yet, but most of the module projects can be removed from the solution (except for some projects in MouseUtils due to VCM depending on them), which cuts down the number of projects from ~200 to just 40.

Starting the application from VS like that works fine, but it messes with the settings of the live application, because it's reading the same registry entries (and it initializes every module to be enabled), so the settings-related logic (and UI) of all the other modules need to be stripped out too.

-----

BTW someone asked in another thread about the claim regarding low usage and if there's telemetry data behind the decision. There is a small Telemetry project in the solution and `TelemetryBase.cs` has a comment on top that says:

> // WARNING: THIS FILE GETS REPLACED ON THE BUILD FARM

I wonder what's the replacement logic. :D"
36339,closed,Deprecate Video Conference Mute in v0.88,2627326210,sleepyeyesvince,2025-01-31T13:20:20Z,"FWIW I've managed to figure a workaround.
Primarily using this:
[https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets)

Installation is as outlined in the linked project page:
In an administrator Terminal PowerShell Window:

`Install-Module -Name AudioDeviceCmdlets`

You can test with command:

`Set-AudioDevice -RecordingMuteToggle`

Then I made an old school batch file (I tried with a PowerShell .ps1 but I'm not good with it and couldn't get it to work well with the following steps below).

In my MicMute.bat:

`powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -Command ""Set-AudioDevice -RecordingMuteToggle""`

I saved MicMute.bat somewhere (%USERPROFILE%\Documents\).

1. Open PowerToys ""Keyboard Manager"" module and enable it
2. Click Remap a shortcut
3. Click + Add shortcut remapping
4. Under ""Select:"" on the left, click the Shortcut pencil button and record the keyboard combination you want to use (eg Ctrl + /). Hit OK.
5. Under ""To:"" choose the ""Action:"" dropdown as ""Run Program"". Click ""Select Program"" button and locate your saved MicMute.bat.
6. [Optional: Change the ""Visibility"" to ""Hidden"" if you don't want a window popping up when the script runs]
7. Leave other options as default, particularly, leave ""Target Apps:"" blank (defaults to ""All apps"")
8. Hit ""OK"" at the top right of the ""Remap shortcuts"" window
9. Now test by hitting your shortcut.

One caveat with the removal of VCM, it appears the little toolbar showing the microphone was muted was also removed. I haven't quite figured out how to replace that yet, but I'll look further into it. If someone has an idea?

Windows 11 has this icon in the notification area that appears when a program uses the microphone. it correctly toggles when launching the powershell command:

Almost all the same reasons held for why we wanted to do it back with 0.67 still hold true.  It is very difficult to test, debug in general, different webcam hardware caused issues, Arm64 quirks, had accessibility issues, it actually is x86 vs 64-bit, and extremely low usage from telemetry compared to other PowerToys utilities.  The complexities of the virtual driver added to installing, upgrading, and uninstalling PowerToys also added to my decision.

I do know it does actively impact those who did that and usage is usage.  As a user, you have choices and we respect that.  Our team cares deeply about users and giving everyone extremely powerful utilities.

As an open-source project, if someone does find it useful, 100% please fork / leverage our code.

Thank you for the contribution. But unfortunately we can't accept this PR.

1. This is the wrong way of implementing this. Please read the docs under https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/blob/main/doc%2Fdevdocs%2Fcommon%2FFilePreviewCommon.md .
2. You did not ask for implementation of the csv part. This is tricky as it may override the explorer default preview handling and may prevents Excel from handling it."

Sorry, I don't think I explained the aims very well.

The intention is to use the Monaco renderer as a plaintext viewer for AutoHotKey scripts and other currently unsupported file extensions. The decision was deliberately made not to add these as new languages to Monaco, or as extensions to existing supported Monaco languages. This has the following advantages:

- Plaintext files do not require syntax highlighting or any other special processing. They are for quick unformatted display only.
- We can add new file extensions to the list much more easily than adding a new language to Monaco.
- If a new language or syntax highlighting for a file type is added to Monaco's supported list, this will be automatically used, superseding the plaintext rendering.
- Users themselves can add their own file extensions to the list without needing us to release a new version of PowerToys. (This is why I didn't hard-code the file extensions and created the new text file instead.)

Essentially, this adds a plaintext preview capability which just uses Monaco as the rendering engine, and I should have made that clearer. Apologies.

I understand that I didn't ask about the CSV or TSV additions. I wanted to provide an example that showed that a file extension could be handled either with a preview handler (for those viewing CSVs with Microsoft Office installed) or with Monaco (for those without Office using this plaintext renderer). There is code within the PR which specifically excludes those extensions which are supported by the ShellHandlerPreviewer, using its `IsItemSupported()` feature directly.

I still think this is a worthwhile approach to displaying files which do not need special processing. If this PR is unsuitable, I would like to raise it as another issue and perhaps explain it better and open it up to further discussion.

Thanks again."

1. Only the changes for AHK are discussed.
2. The way we did it till yet is updating the language json in Monaco. But this PR implements a different way to define supported extensions for plain text that never has neen discussed in the issue and allows manual user configuration in a text file.
3. The now configuration file is not configurable through setting ui.

I think we should discuss first if we want this.

We do reg stuff for stuff on and off for when we but this does get a little complicated i think.  If we shifted to more of a mental model like what #32817 it would unblock the ""now"" and get these extensions supported in both, no?

I am not 100% what yout want to say because your comment seems to miss some words.

But the PR you referenced/adding the extensions to `languages.json` is the preferred way we do since ever. Doing this is easy and simple and I think for now the best solution to get the preview part of this PR in. What do you think @Aaron-Junker ?

Later and discussed in a new issue we can implement a way for our users to add their own extension for txt files through PT settings."

The .txt file for user settings was not a good decision on my part. As @crutkas says, user entries would potentially be overwritten each install. Having an extra 'user-only' file where the user could list their own extensions could be a possibility, but discoverability would be a problem, it would be fragile, and it's all information I accept should really be exposed by an official PowerToys settings property.

I agree that the way forward is to create a new issue for user-configurable plain text file support. I can certainly do that. I'm afraid I'm unfamiliar with the settings system at the moment, but I'll ask if I need a hand.

Likewise, I can edit the `monaco_languages.json` and `monacoSpecialLanguages.js` files and hopefully that will cover the AutoHotKey requirement, which was the original issue. You know, before I went and complicated everything 🙄

Do you think it would be better if I closed this off and handled that via another PR?

1. Implementing the user configurable plain text extension in a separate issue and pr sounds good. Please create the issue that we can discuss a good way of implementation. Later we can help with implementation.
2. For the implementation of the original issues (.csv, .tsv, .ahk) as plain text using the currently approved way please open a new and clean PR. That easier to review.

This means the commit window outside the visible desktop bounds. The commit window can be closed with <kbd>ESC</kbd>, no need to kill the app.

From your description the 2nd monitor is your primary monitor. I believe I've observed a similar behaviour in multi monitor setups (I don't have one any longer)."

You need to setup a dual monitor environment. 
The monitor (1) is a FullHD/text 100%
The monitor (2) is a 4K/text 150%
Note that they are not a precise ""extended"" desktop, because the monitor (1) is not aligned to (2) on top.

If you can open the commit window in one monitor, it will disappear if, after closing it, the main window is dragged into the other monitor. In a nutshel, the commit window will become visible *ONLY* if was previously saved on the *SAME* monitor where it is restored. 100% reproducible.

So the window will appear offscreen, but without any cue icon in the taskbar it is impossible to move. 
Of course pressing ESC will close the window, now user can move the main form into the *OTHER* monitor, and in this case commit form will appear again to screen (because the main form is now on the same screen where the child form has been saved before).

I do not fully understand the point about submodules. It might become resolved when considering the `DiffStatus` for the grouping, too.

👍 Should not be difficult for grouping (same as the already implemented handling if there is only one group).

I am adding `Collapse`, `Expand` and `Select all`. In the follow-up for adding a file-tree mode or later, special menu items or behavior can be added.

Yes, if one has a good idea. But not the first file - same as in the ""File tree"".

I agree. My main use of range diff is to see equal (and skipped) revisions. So a different icon would be good. Proposals?
For the additional diff groups, I was thinking of overlays ""B"", ""A"", ""C""ombined. An ""R"" overlay might suffice for range diff, too."

I consider a changed submodule as a changed file.
There is no special icon for both changed (or only A/B)  for submodules

Overlay in general would be good for these icons. The variants (both changed etc) need to be changed for dark mode anyway.

`TreeView` has several limitations, particularly icons:
`StateImages` are limited to 14 (only a runtime error when trying to use a higher index). `StateImages` are scaled in a special way.
`Images` work better. But it looks ugly if some nodes have no icon.
With `OwnerDrawAll`, one needs to draw everything including tree lines, which feels like implementing the tree view control from scratch, what I do not want to do.

Tooltips are automatically provided - if `Text` matches the owner-drawn length. I saw the wrong selection highlight length, too. I am adapting this.

> Should changed submodules be in modified status group? Now they are separated.

""Sort by status"" is a TODO yet and should yield the same ordering as before. New subgroups or changes in the ordering should be added in a follow-up.

I prefer a one-stop shop. A ""tree / flat"" toggle could be useful in addition.
Later, we should add a toolbar with sort options and filtering.
FormCommit and artificial commits could use a separate sorting setting."

If a file is the only file in a subfolder, no subfolder-node is created but the folder icon is added to the file as `StateImage` (with arbitrary scaling by the TreeView control).
Without the folder icon, one could miss the fact that the file is located in a subfolder.

The mentioned more logical sorting could simply be achieved in a separate PR by moving up the submodule icons in `CreateImageListData`.

Then we could remove `DiffStatus` from `GetStatusKey` again and rely on the order of `images` in `CreateImageListData`.

There is still no icons for all submodule status, so this would require more icons. (4*9 of mostly new icons, as the ""overlay"" will not look good if applied as for the other icons.)

Suggestion to add colors to the icons (icon for the multiparent diff for combined should have this icon, it is not Diff-onlyA), pushed to private branch feature/filestatuslist_tree

It had been even worse before I added setting `TopNode` when restoring the selection in `UpdateFileStatusListView`.

Sorry that it broke how you use it.
It is not too late because the answer is the same: In principle, yes because it is _soft_ ware. But it would be much effort for little benefit.

Multi-selection works with `Ctrl+click` and `Shift+click`. (`Ctrl+A` works the same as before.)
At least with #12149, I do not see much need for or value in features like
- be able to have **no** selection
- select multiple entries **from bottom** with the mouse
  With #12149, just select a diff group or a folder and operate on all contained items.
  It should not be too difficult to add a generic click and drag for selecting multiple files - to `MultiSelectTreeView`.

Everything can be improved.
It is possible to change the behavior back to the 3.5 so when opening separate instances, they use the FileHistory.

I want to set FileHistory as deprecated, remove it at some point together with other forms like Compare.
This is quite some extra code to maintain.

Note that FileHistory (both before and in master) can be used to show history for several files or folders.

>     1. Before it was a clearly identifiable different view. Now it's difficult to distinguish to a normal instance

How to make this clearer? 
Suggestion in next question.

Personally, I hardly use the extra instance, just filters in current Browse (`F` in Diff/Tree) then clear the filter (`Shift-Ctrl-F` in grid).
 
>     2. There is a lot less space to see the diff and blame. And you always have to move the split separator. Sometimes a diff was difficult to read, so now that you can't see the whole file and have a blame view, it will be worst :(

Some shortcut to collapse the left panel as well as the FileStatusList?
(Could be default when open with file filter).

>     3. You loose the ""View"" tab (that I sometimes I preferred to use because I found the blame aggressive when you move your mouse and the grey selection change)

The ""filtered file"" is preselected in Diff/Tree.
You can view the file instead of blame in Tree tab with `B` (as well as Blame in Diff).

>     4. You no more are able to identify quickly which instance is file history (and when you want to switch quickly and often during an investigation or when you want to clean the instances opened, its a pain) lost in all similar windows

The title is already adjusted when there is a file filter, FileHistory could be added too. Or just put the filtered path name first?

>     5. Maybe when we open a new instance to enable the ""Path filter"", the left panel should be hidden

See 2.

>     6. I don't know if it make sense also to filter the file list also

The file is preselected, also when you change commit (unless you select a file that is in the newly selected commit too), so I do not see a need here.
If something, add the file status list filter.
 
>     7. Perf: It takes more time to open the file history in another window. And because it's a full GitExtension instance, it also fetch in background if enable, do the `git status` that could take a lot of CPU on big repositories.

With the repo loading tweaks in master, I find opening Browse similar to FileHistory before.
(Also not using separate instances much.)

See above, but I would like to prepare to remove.

>     9. I'm pretty sure the ""Filtering"" icon is not enough visible for legacy user that will have it enabled when doing ""File History"" as usual (and that we will have some issues opened). And a dropdown menu (like the stash button) to disable quickly the filters could be an improvement...

Dropdown for Advanced filter would be nice.
(I settled with implementing the shortcut eventually, there were too much going on.)

My intention was that you only do the blame temporary that you go to FileTree for longer term blame.

For Blame in diff tab, it is not trivial to only change from Blame when selecting a new file, I would like to get consensus if that is the way to go before looking into it.

I think it is a good step in the right direction but I think we could improve it a little.

Here are for me useful things:
1. I like the idea of the ""File History"" text we had before but (1) it is too long and hide the filename in the task bar preview (2) it could be wrong when you display a folder history => Proposition: Use an emoji instead
2. The file name is the more important information (and the path is too long) => Proposition: display filename and after directory path like ""filename.cs [directory/path/to/file]""

After a quick test using an emoji, I end up with something like that (when applied on the File History form because it was easier for me) and that I think render quite well

with the code `.Append($""⏱️ {Path.GetFileName(FileName)} [{Path.GetDirectoryName(FileName)}]"");`

edit: or in `AppTitleGenerator.cs`:

```csharp
            // Pathname normally have quotes already
            pathName = string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(pathName)
                ? """"
                    : $""⏱️ {Path.GetFileName(pathName.Trim('""'))} [{Path.GetDirectoryName(pathName.Trim('""'))}]"";
```

What do you think?

> 13. The blame icon should have been reset here (or keep blame until another file is selected...)

Maybe when we select another file, it could be acceptable to display the diff but when we select another revision, use the ""Blame this revision"" or ""Blame previous revision"", we **must** stay in blame mode. And yes the state of the icon should well reflect the current state so there is at least a bug to fix here.

13b. Another thing linked here: In the file history, the revision grid is filtered on the file you blame. I think we should keep this behavior. That would allow the user to change the selected revision easily otherwise when clicking in a revision, you left the blame mode (especially if the commit has not changes on this file) which break the user workflow."

A problem with the current master is the lack of testing. Most of that is done by maintainers...
Comments like this is important before more users test.

All is done on the free time so I hope you and others get more time.
I am getting stuck with too many open PRs.

I adopted the suggestion to handle path filters that do not resolve file names.
Maybe there is a better emoji, lets use this for now.

I prefer the ""old"" way too, as it worked for my workflows (e.g. looking up histories for several files simultaneously). I found the ""new"" blame restrictive in terms of flexibility. 
One extra benefits of having a separate dialog for me was that the dialog has knobs and toggles specific to the History view. How we need to expose the same controls on the main dialog, which has a questionable UX value proposition.

I'm personally not seeing this as an improvement - we're overloading the title bar with information - we have a) repo name, b) repo branch, c) app name and now we have additional information which can be arbitrary long. I think we need to reconsider what information is present in the title bar.

I _think_ I like the idea with the emoji, but I'm finding the chosen emoji confusing. For file history I'd expect something like these (though I don't know if these are available as emojis):
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4403806/148631673-82144b17-debd-4d64-9797-9309c916db4a.png)

I also not finding ""filename.cs [directory/path/to/file]"" over ""directory/path/to/file/filename.cs"", as it adds an additional layer of mental indirection. Perhaps we should apply shortening strategies we apply in other places.

I feel the PRs are independent of the default presentation of file history.

In general, it has always been possible to filter paths in Browse, it was just that it did not work well (no revision grid for instance...).
Some of the improvements has benefited FileHistory too. The moved settings related to history/blame is something I have hunted around for anyway too.
The only that could affect the ""3.5"" handling as I see it is the default when opening a repo with path filter as well as Blame is the default in FileTree.
I want to keep that, but I do not have a majority vote...

Presentation of filters is an important piece here I believe. Not just the title bar #9806 and indicators in the tool bar #9807 but the UI changes pmiossec suggested here with the sidebar etc.

In what way? You can open FileHistory for folders etc in separate instances as before, ""inline"" filters is added functionality.

> One extra benefits of having a separate dialog for me was that the dialog has knobs and toggles specific to the History view. How we need to expose the same controls on the main dialog, which has a questionable UX value proposition.

What controls?
Settings is the only I see.
You get Blame by default in the FileTree (unless you use View by default, if that what was slowing you down).
For me the limitations in FileHistory was very frustrating.

The reason I originally used a shortcut only to quickly disable filters was the lack of a *Checked* state for `ToolStripSplitButton`.
The presentation that Browse has filters could be a separate issue, but it relates to the defaults."

Blame mode could be off by default or switch to file when another file is selected like in Diff tab.

Default (invariant, what is in the code) is used if the theme cannot be loaded.
However, the darksilver as well as dark theme has not been included with GE 4/5, so no change here."

I meant we should release a v5.2 with the bug fixes #12122 & #12129 and, optionally, with the low-risk feature #12023 (used for several months; and we have a fallback: the much slower ConEmu).
Most of Gerhard's refactoring PRs are pretty safe for merging before v5.2.
But this PR changes a lot and does not work well for FormCommit yet. So, there would be a risk that we would quickly need to release 5.2.1 if it causes more side-effects.

I would appreciate a soon release of v5.2. Then we could switch to .NET 9 and merge the fresh features (theming, tree view) and let them mature and be extended."

I believe a 5.2 should be done soon, many nice corrections by mstv lately.
Release from master (I could consider #12116 too)

The changes I have in non draft for themeing should all have no effect on the default theme (I hope I have described all, forgot to mention src/app/GitUI/Editor/RebaseTodoHighlightingStrategy.cs)
This is the big one and also if mstv had not seen a problem, I would not merge it before a 5.2

I would like to merge the preparing PRs together so the actual changes for the theme are minimized and discussions can be on actual issues."
